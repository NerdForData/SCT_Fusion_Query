In particular, the problems which originate de- fects have to be detected in time and the related causes should be resolved as soon as possible to reduce the large amount of wafers discarded. In addition to the in-line control for the detection of chip failures, some electrical tests are performed (circuit probe — CP) on the final product.

Such maps present specific fault models and provide crucial infor- mation to keep track of process problems in semiconduc- tor manufacturing. Production monitoring often relies on the \"evaluation\" of experts who visually explore map tem- plates: such approach leads to a biased judgement, it is time consuming and it is also limited by the ability of hu- man perception.

INTRODUCTION In-line wafer inspection systems are utilized to detect defects and identify the causes of abnormalities that occur early in the manufacturing process.1In these systems, an imaging device with a microscope captures and detects defects from images. The importance of using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for visual inspection to detect small defects in semiconductor manufacturing is increasingly recognized. In general, when the sensitivity of defect detection is increased to identify small defects on the nanometer scale, it often results in a higher number of false positives due to manufacturing variations in the circuit pattern. The main challenge in defect inspection is how to suppress false positives caused by manufacturing variations while detecting defects with high sensitivity.

REDUCING FALSE POSITIVES USING PATTERN BINNING Defect inspection equipment identiﬁes the locations of defects in captured images through image processing. A common approach is to calculate the gray-level diﬀerence between the input image and the reference image and then extract areas where this diﬀerence exceeds a deﬁned criteria as candidate defects. For the extracted candidate defects, the system discriminates between real defects and false positives, outputting only those iden- tiﬁed as real defects. A simple processing method involves quantifying the likelihood of a defect candidate being an actual defect as an anomaly score and then discriminating by applying a threshold to score.

In this study, we propose machine learning-based segmentation technology to classify inspection areas without requiring additional information such as design data or user annotations. By adjusting sensitivity for each segment, it becomes possible to achieve both enhanced detection sensitivity and reduced false positives. Fig. 1illustrates the ﬂow of the defect detection process with sensitivity adjustment applied using this method. The image is divided into multiple segments based on the appearance of the circuit pattern such as the cell area, peripheral circuit, and intermediate area. Since false positives frequently occur in areas with signiﬁcant manufacturing variations, such as the intermediate area, lowering the detection sensitivity of the segments corresponding to the intermediate area can eﬀectively reduce the occurrence of false positives.

PATTERN BINNING METHOD BASED ON UNSUPERVISED LEARNING In recent years, deep neural networks have led to signiﬁcant advancements in performance for many tasks, in- cluding image classiﬁcation and segmentation. However, achieving a high performance requires a large amount of user-provided data with accurate labels. In particular, image segmentation requires precise pixel-level annota- tion, which is an extremely labor-intensive and costly process. In the context of this research, which focuses on circuit pattern segmentation, accurate pixel annotation based on the appearance of various elements like memory cells, peripheral areas, and intermediate areas is essential.

Circuit patterns vary in appearance depending on the device and layer, and these appearances are likely to evolve with changes in the manufacturing process. Consequently, it is impractical to pre-learn all circuit patterns, making it necessary to adapt learning directly on the production line. Given the high cost associated with manual annotation for segmentation, it is impractical to adapt on supervised learning methods. Therefore, leveraging image segmentation technology that utilizes unsupervised learning becomes crucial to reduce false positives and manage costs eﬀectively. Invariant information clustering (IIC),3which utilizes mutual information, has been proposed as a technique for clustering and segmenting images without the need for user annotations.

Binnin g is due to the in- herent variability in semiconductor manufacturing processes. The output of manufacturing processes that produce integrated circuits (IC) is highly variable in terms of clock speed, memory and other characteristics. A process that is started with the objective of producing a speciﬁc IC with a desired speed may produce both faster and slowe r ones, as well as the desired ones. Faster ones are frequently downgraded to the des ired speed level, in order to satisfy the demand at that level. Another complicating factor is the use of process capabili- ties. A process plan for producing a given product may require a spe ciﬁc type of equipment, or a speciﬁc processing capability that may exist on diﬀerent types o f machines. This creates an overlap between diﬀerent types of machines, creating bundle co nstraints that complicates the problem further.

INTRODUCTION Productionplanninginthesemiconductor industry ischallenging duet ocomplicating factors such as binning and downgrading, and the use of process capabilities as resources, instead of speciﬁc equipment units or equipment types. A silicon wafer consis ts of a number of integrated circuits (IC) put together in a circular disk. The equipme nt that is used in man- ufacturing silicon wafers is expensive. This necessitates using the e quipment for a large number of processing steps. For this reason, process ﬂows in sem iconductor manufacturing are re-entrant, i.e. wafers visit the same type of machine many time s during their manu- facture. Binning is another challenge that complicates the problem b y adding uncertainty to the output of the production process, not only in the form of va riable output quantity, but also in the form of variable output product types.

Downgrading is the practice of as- signing higher quality (higher speed or memory) products to lesser q uality demand, since additional demand for the higher quality product does not exist and /or the demand for the lesser quality ones must be urgently satisﬁed. Average bin fraction s for a process plan are -761- usually known. The usual practice is to plan for the average bin frac tions rather than the intended output. Another complicating factor is the use of process capabilities. A pro cess plan for producing a given product may require a speciﬁc type of equipment, or a speciﬁ c processing capability, which may exist on diﬀerent types of machines. This creates an over lap between diﬀerent types of machines, which complicates the problem further, by addin g bundle constraints.

A process plan is a set of processing steps that is intended to produ ce a certain product, but it results in a set of products that diﬀer by memory, clock speed , etc., due to binning. Note that each of the output items that result from a process plan that diﬀer by at least one characteristic is a diﬀerent product. The manufacturing reso urces that are used in the facility are represented by “equipment types” and “processing ca pabilities” in our model. One machine is capable of performing a number of diﬀerent steps, ea ch of which represents a “processing capability.” Some process plan steps specify a certain e quipment type, whereas others specify a certain capability.

Introduction As the complexity of semiconductor manufacturing processes esca- lates, the defects in wafers generated during production have become more diverse and intricate. A wafer bin map (WBM) displays the test results for each chip on a wafer, based on the chip probe test failure mode and the chip’s position (die). The chip probe test, a crucial final evaluation after the entire manufacturing process, assesses the performance and functionality of each chip. During this test, each die undergoes multiple probe test modes, with the first failure mode being recorded as the bin result. Throughout the wafer fabrication process, various manufacturing issues may cause multiple dies on a wafer to be defective. These defects often cluster in one or several areas on the wafer, forming spatial patterns known as gross failure areas "}

These defects often cluster in one or several areas on the wafer, forming spatial patterns known as gross failure areas (GFAs). These patterns, including common types like ring, scratch, loc, and centers, are indicative of specific process-related issues and contain valuable data for improving yield and quality ( Kim & Kang , 2021 ).

Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a complex WBM, detailing both the bin categories and the GFAs present. Furthermore, Fig. 2 showcases additional real-world complex WBMs, each featuring different types of GFAs and assorted bin mixtures. In practical settings, complex WBMs are most prevalent. However, for simplification, early research primar- ily concentrated on binary WBMs, which are derived from multi-bin WBMs based on the passing or failing bin categories ( Alawieh, Boning, & Pan , 2020 ; Nakazawa & Kulkarni , 2019 ; Saqlain, Jargalsaikhan, & Lee, 2019 ; Wang & Ni , 2019 ; Wu, Jang, & Chen , 2015 ; Yu & Lu , 2016 ). In recent years, there has been a notable shift toward more nuanced classifications. Several studies have been dedicated to multi-GFA binary WBM classification ( Chiu & Chen , 2021 ; Kim, Lee, & Kim , 2018 ; Kong https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123601 Received 1 September 2023; Received in revised form 28 February 2024; Accepted 1 March 2024 Expert Systems With Applications 249 (2024) 123601 2Y.

Most recently, the first deep learning-based method specifically tailored for complex WBMs was introduced ( Wang and Ni , 2023 ). Deep learning methods typically depend on extensive labeled datasets for model training, a requirement that becomes even more pronounced with the intricate nature of complex WBMs. The sophis- tication of these maps substantially escalates the complexity of model structures, necessitating substantial labeled data to attain satisfactory results ( Sun, Shrivastava, Singh, & Gupta , 2017 ). In the real-world scenario of wafer fabrication, the availability of labeled data is consid- erably limited due to the laborious and time-intensive nature of manual labeling.

In response to the aforementioned requirements, this study intro- duces a self-supervised learning framework utilizing a masked autoen- coder (MAE) for complex WBM classification. MAE, recognized as an effective self-supervised method ( He et al. , 2021 ), employs vision trans- formers (ViT) as both encoder and decoder, marking its first application to WBMs. Employing MAE for self-supervised learning substantially enhances WBM classification by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data for pre-training, coupled with a modest amount of labeled data for fine- tuning.

Related work Over recent decades, numerous unsupervised learning methods have emerged, leveraging large-scale unlabeled data for feature represen- tation learning ( Ciresan, Meier, Gambardella, & Schmidhuber , 2010 ; Donoho & Grimes , 2003 ; Erhan et al. , 2010 ; Goodfellow, Courville, & Bengio , 2011 ; Olshausen & Field , 1996 ; Ranzato, Boureau, & LeCun , 2007 ; Rifai, Vincent, Muller, Glorot, & Bengio , 2011 ; Roweis , 1997 ; Roweis & Saul , 2000 ; Seide, Li, & Yu , 2011 ; Vincent, Larochelle, Bengio, & Manzagol , 2008 ; Weinberger & Saul , 2004 ).

Current self-supervised approaches for image visual features fall into four categories: generation-based ( Goodfellow et al. , 2014 ; Ledig et al. , 2016 ; Pathak, Krahenbuhl, Donahue, Darrell, & Efros , 2016 ; Zhang, Isola, & Efros , 2016 ; Zhu, Park, Isola, & Efros , 2017 ), context- based ( Caron, Bojanowski, Joulin, & Douze , 2018 ; Doersch, Gupta, & Efros , 2015 ; Jing & Tian , 2018 ; Li et al. , 2016 ; Noroozi & Favaro , 2016 ; Noroozi, Vinjimoor, Favaro, & Pirsiavash , 2018 ), contrastive- based ( Caron et al. , 2020 ; Chen, Xie, & He , 2021 ; Grill, Strub, Altche, Tallec, & Richemond , 2020 ; He, Fan, Wu, Xie, & Girshick , 2020 ; van den Oord, Li, "}

During the fine-tuning phase, a significant amount of labeled data is still required to attain high classification performance. As noted in Dosovitskiy et al. (2021 ) and Vaswani et al. (2017 ), classification performance deteriorates markedly with reduced labeled data, which constrains the practicality of these methods. Addi- tionally, existing strategies primarily address single GFA binary WBMs, limiting their applicability as most real-world WBMs are complex, encompassing multiple bin categories and GFAs. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a self-supervised learning framework tailored for complex WBMs, requiring only minimal annotations. 3. Proposed method 3.1.

For complex WBMs, the self- supervised learning stage includes a patchMC encoder block and an MAE block. During self-supervision, large-scale unlabeled WBMs are utilized for visual representation learning. Initially, the patchMC encoder encodes complex WBMs into feature embeddings, producing embeddings for each patch. Subsequently, the MAE engages in masking and recon- structing blocks to further enhance WBM representations using a ViTencoder. The masking block obscures a portion of the patches, while the ViT encoder transforms the remaining unmasked patches into final embeddings. The ViT decoder then reconstructs the masked patches. Post self-supervised learning, the patchMC and ViT encoder are fine- tuned with a small labeled dataset for classification. The subsequent sections detail each component. 3.2. PatchMC encoder block The patchMC encoder, designed for complex WBMs with multiple bin categories, transforms a two-dimensional matrix representing a chip’s failure test mode into a series of feature maps.

These maps are then converted into randomly masked sequences incorporating one- hot encoding, multi-channel 2DCNN, patch embedding, and position embedding. One-hot encoding and multi-channel 2DCNN are pivotal innovations of this process. The encoder’s diagram is shown in Fig. 4. In a complex WBM, each matrix element signifies a bin category, a categorical variable without numerical meaning. We employ one-hot encoding to transform each bin category into a vector, converting the WBM into multi-channel 2D data (Eq.

The convolution filter’s x- and y-axes extract spatial features, while the 𝑧-axis focuses on bin features. Adding one- hot encoding and multi-channel 2DCNN has significantly enhanced classification performance, as detailed in Section 4.2. For the multi-channel 2D CNN layer, we employ a kernel of size (3,3,31,8) to transform the input data into feature maps (Eq. (2)): 𝑋𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 =𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 (𝑋𝑜𝑛𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑡 );𝑋𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 ∈𝑅𝐻 𝑃×𝑊 𝑃×𝑓(2) In this equation, 𝑋𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 is the CNN output, 𝑃is the patch size (also the stride), and 𝑓is the filter number. Optimal values for 𝑃and𝑓 were determined to be three and eight, respectively, as shown in the experimental section. Subsequently, these feature maps are converted into a sequence of flattened patches and mapped to embeddings 𝐸𝑝𝑎(Eq.

Each patch encompasses coupled features of bin categories and spatial distributions. For optimal performance, values for 𝑃and𝐷are set to three and 96, respectively, as discussed in the experiment section. Following the approach in Dosovitskiy et al.

MAE block The MAE comprises the masking block, ViT encoder, and ViT de- coder. In the masking block, one part of the patches is randomly sampled as masked patches, and the remaining patches are unmasked. In this study, similar to He et al.

The masking formula is as follows: 𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 =𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 (𝐸);𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 ∈𝑅(𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 ×(𝐻×𝑊 𝑃2+1))× 𝐷(5) Then, the ViT encoder processes only visible, unmasked patches.

The softmax activation function is defined as follows: 𝑝𝑐(𝑥) = exp( 𝑎𝑐(𝑥))∕(𝐶∑ 𝑐′exp(𝑎𝑐′(𝑥))) (9) where 𝑎𝑐(𝑥)denotes the activation function in the bin dimension 𝑐 at the die position 𝑥, where 𝑥∈𝑋𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡;𝑝𝑐(𝑥)is the approximated maximum-function. The baseline MAE method is used for images with RGB pixels, and the reconstruction process is based on pixel-level prediction. Since an RGB is a continuous numerical value, the mean square error (MSE) function is selected as the loss function (He et al., 2021). In this study, the element is the bin category of each die. Thus, we proposed to use a die-level cross-entropy loss to compute the cross-entropy between the reconstructed and original WBMs in the die-level on masked dice instead of the mean square error (MSE) loss in the baseline MAE.

To address the multi-GFA classification problem, this study applies a multi-label fine-tuning method. The multi-label classifier consists of a patchMC encoder, a ViT encoder, and a classification head with a linear layer and an activation function. The patchMC and ViT encoders’ initialization weights are transferred from the MAE self-supervised pre-training, while the classification head’s weights are randomly initialized. The ViT decoder of MAE is not utilized during the fine-tuning period. The multi-label fine-tuning differs from single-label fine-tuning in three ways. First, the ground truth is a multi-hot vector, compared to the one-hot vector in single-label fine-tuning. In a multi-hot vector, ones indicate existing GFA types, while zeros represent non-existent ones. Second, the activation function is sigmoid instead of softmax, mapping each value in an 𝑛-dimensional vector to the range of (0,1), allowing for independent values unlike softmax.

After applying the sigmoid function, each predicted value represents the likelihood of a particular GFA type’s existence. To determine if a GFA exists, each predicted value is compared with a threshold.

Data and experimental setup In the experiments, we utilized a real-world complex WBM dataset collected by Intel to verify the performance of the proposed framework and conduct an ablation study on the patchMC encoder and multi-label fine-tuning. The complex WBM dataset comprises 180,000 unlabeled WBMs for self-supervised learning and 2070 labeled WBMs spanning 12 GFA types for the fine-tuning period. For IP protection, this paper does not disclose the categories and examples of the 12 GFAs in the dataset. Many WBMs in the dataset feature multiple GFA types labeled by experienced engineers.

We acknowledge that 20 to 40 labels are a manageable amount for manual labeling by engineers in practice. Additionally, we sampled two few-shot trainsets to evaluate the few-shot classification performance of the proposed method, with details presented later. A complex WBM is a 39 ×26 2D matrix. We resized the original complex WBM to 39 ×39 square matrices, and the total number of bin categories is 31.

Thus, we opti- mized them by comparing classification performance after fine-tuning with varying hyperparameters. For the patchMC encoder, we compared different CNN depths and widths following Wang, Ni (2023).

Ablation study for patchMC encoder on complex WBM To assess the effectiveness of the proposed patchMC encoder for complex WBMs, we compared two self-supervised learning scenarios: MAE with the patchMC encoder and MAE without it. Initially, the unlabeled complex WBM dataset was used for self-supervised learning. Subsequently, the labeled training set was employed for multi-label fine-tuning, and the test set was utilized to calculate classification precision, reflecting the performance of self-supervised learning. When MAE is without the patchMC encoder, a complex WBM is transformed into a three-channel, 64 ×64 pixel RGB image, and the complex WBMs are input directly into the ViT encoder of MAE without one-hot encoding and multi-channel 2DCNN. The overall classification precision of the test set for the two cases are 0.956 and 0.558, respectively.

A detailed description of the comparison methods and results are presented in the following. The first comparison method is TSM’21 (Kahng & Kim, 2021), where self-supervision is achieved by minimizing a contrastive loss function that encourages features extracted from the original, non-augmented WBM, and its augmented counterparts to cluster together.

Thus, performance improved significantly for different labeled data scales consistently. This advantage is even more apparent with fewer labeled data samples. Additionally, the number of fine-tuning epochs for TSM’21 was 100, while that for the proposed method was only 30.

Performance evaluation on multi-label binary WBM dataset MixedWM38 is a publicly available binary WBM dataset charac- terized by mixed-type defect patterns. To evaluate the classification performance of our proposed method on binary WBMs with such complex defect patterns, we conducted experiments on this dataset. Originally published by Wang, Xu, et al. (2020), MixedWM38 in- cludes one fault-free pattern, eight single defect patterns, thirteen 2 mixed-type patterns, twelve 3 mixed-type defect patterns, and four 4 mixed-type defects, totaling 38,015 WBMs. For WBMs with a sin- gle defect pattern, the ground truth is represented by 8-dimensional one-hot vectors. In contrast, for WBMs with multiple defect patterns, 8-dimensional multi-hot vectors are used, where ones indicate the presence of specific defect patterns, and zeros denote their absence. The dataset consists of WBMs of 52 ×52 dimensions, which we resized to 64 ×64 for our method. In the pre-training phase, all 38,015 data were utilized.

Discussion From the experiment results for complex WBMs, employing large- scale unlabeled data for self-supervised learning with an enhanced MAE and a patchMC encoder, a multi-label classifier fine-tuned with a small set of labeled data achieves a 96.7% classification precision. Further- more, when comparing MAE with established self-supervised learning methods and CNN-based supervised baselines, our results support that MAE outperforms these comparative methods for complex WBM data. The few-shot classification results reveal that both 3-shot and 5- shot classification accuracies exceed 90%, indicating that as few as 3 or 5 labeled data for each GFA type are sufficient to fine-tune an effective classifier.

In addition, after self-supervised learning, a multi-label fine-tuning method is proposed for multi-GFA WBM classification. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on a real-world complex WBM dataset. Ablation studies prove the necessity and effectiveness of patchMC encoder. Few-shot classification results indicate that the proposed framework can achieve a high classifica- tion accuracy with few labeled data. Moreover, by comparing MAE with other existing self-supervised learning methods, we proved that using MAE for WBM self-supervised learning outperforms other existing self-supervised learning approaches. Finally, future work will focus on the object detection approaches combined with self-supervised learning and few-shot learning to de- tect more complex GFA with local features and very weak signals to improve the classification performance for complex WBMs. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yi Wang: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.

Silicon data is presented. Keywords: Process Monitor, Speed Binning, Die Matching, 3D Integration I. INTRODUCTION When integrating systems, it is important to match dice with similar performance. This results in systems with wider performance range which can then be binned for different price points. Similarly, in 3D layouts, as shown in Figure 1, 2 or more dice are stacked on top of each other. The stacked dice are connected using through silicon via (TSV) and finally packaged. Stacked dice should match in their performance. Thus dice are binned into performance bins before stacking. This problem is similar to the speed-binning problem. Figure 1. Example of one form of 3D Layout Speed binning has been studied in the context of binning microprocessors, DSP etc. We address the problem of test time optimization for speed binning. The motivation is to reduce test cost. It is difficult to find published papers on binning. The standard methodology for speed binning is to use max frequency search.

The standard methodology for speed binning is to use max frequency search. It uses at-speed manufacturing tests to search for the max frequency. Tests used are system tests for system assembly, functional tests for microprocessors, and structural tests for ASICs. The search for max frequency is very time consuming and smaller speed-binning subset of the tests is used to reduce the test time. This paper proposes an alternative approach to speed binning that reduces test time without sacrificing accuracy. We first investigate using on-chip process monitor (PM) data for max frequency prediction. PMs have been proposed for a variety of applications [1][2][3]. It has also been proposed for speed characterization [4]. For process characterization [4] process monitor accuracy may be adequate. Our interest is in its use in high volume manufacturing for mature processes for which the accuracy requirement are very different.

PROCESS MO NITOR BASED METHODOLOGY ASICs have inbuilt process monitors (PMs) and a variety of them that have been discussed in the literature. In this paper we assume that PMs are ring-oscillator driving the clock pin of a counter for a fixed duration of time. This count C is read out during test. The value of C for a faster die is larger than the value of C for a slower die. A normalized value of C, given by K = Q/C, is used in our study. The value of Q is a constant and chosen such that K is close to 1 for a nominal die. If K is small (large) then we have a fast (slow) die.

We refer to these PMs as NOMY and use the K values from NOMY. NOMY is used to determine the max frequency of a die as follows. First a model for mapping K to F MAX, the max frequency, is developed using a small sample of the die, as described below in subsection A. This model is modified to determine the speed bin for a die as described in subsection B. The binning algorithm so derived is used to bin dice flowing through the production flow. Silicon evaluation of this PM based flow is presented in subsection C. A. A First Pass Process Monitor Based Algorithm The first algorithm builds a model directly mapping the K value to the F MAX value for each clock domain. We use a sample of dice, with different K values, and determine the FMAX of each die. To build this model a golden reference for F MAX of a die is required.

We next investigate that question. Figure 3. Model for SLOW Figure 4. Absolute error for FAST Errors observed for this sample data is analyzed in two different ways. For FAST we plot the absolute difference between FCALC and FMES in Figure 4. The plot is for the entire die population not just the sample used to build the model. If we target 5% accuracy then 16% of the die population does not satisfy the accuracy requirement. If we increase the accuracy requirement to 3.5% then 33% of the die population does not meet the requirement. Figure 5. Error profile for FAST In Figure 5 and Figure 6 we plot the difference between FCALC and F MES for the two clock domains. The most important message from these two figures is that the difference between F CALC and F MES can be both positive and negative.

For that we formally define the notion of a bin. Base frequency of a clock domain is the target frequency for that clock domain. For simplicity, assume two clock domains C1, C2 and with base frequency F1, F2. The frequency range for a bin is based on the bin size as a percentage of the base frequency.

We use a sample Q of dice in the steps outlined below. • Use this sample Q to derive models similar to equations (1), (2). • For each die d in Q, for each clock domain, compute FCALC using models similar to equations (1), (2). • For each die d in Q, calculate BIN(CALC,d) using equation (6) • For each die d in Q, calculate BIN(MES,d) using equation (5) • For the set of points { ( BIN(CALC,d), BIN(MES,d) ): d in Q} find the best fit linear correlation.

There are a number of observations to be made. The error could be both positive and negative and it is equally likely. In addition, the error is spread across the entire process range. However, the data shows that the new algorithm is pretty close to predicting the right bin. Most of the time the calculated bin matches the measured bin or the two of them differ by one. We use this observation in the hybrid algorithm described in Section III. III.

SUMMARY In this paper we studied the problem of determining the correct bin using process monitor data. An algorithm based on process monitor data only was presented, analyzed and evaluated using silicon data. Results show that this algorithm requires some refinements. A hybrid algorithm that combines the process monitor based algorithm with manufacturing test was presented. We presented silicon data that showed that this algorithm improved the test time when compared with other purely manufacturing test based algorithms. One improvement that can be made in a future study is to collect similar results where max frequency search using memory tests are also included.

A single wafer contains hundreds of semiconductor chips. To ensure high yield and quality, it is crucial to swiftly identify and address defects [3 , 4]. Industry engineers conduct inspections, such as electri- cal die sorting (EDS), to detect defective wafers [5 –7]. EDS generates the wafer bin map (WBM) data representing the defect status of each chip on the wafer. As shown in Fig. 1, WBM data is presented as an image, indicating each chip defects or not. These images reveal patterns associated with the causes of defects, aiding in tracing their root causes. However, because of the large volume of WBMs produced daily, it is impractical for engineers to manually classify them. Recent studies have used machine learning and deep learning algorithms to automate the classification of such large volumes of WBM data [8 –10]. However, existing studies have limitations in encompass- ing all practical issues related to the WBM defect classifica- tion.

When a known defect pattern occurs, experts can identify the cause and take appropriate action based on their experience. However, when a novel defect pattern appears, it becomes more challenging to promptly determine its cause. This increases the time required to trace the root cause of the defect and take corrective action, thereby increasing the risk of quality incidents. Hence, models should be capable of detecting both known and new defect patterns. Second, multiple new defect patterns can appear simultaneously. Therefore, the model needs to accurately group and clas- sify identical patterns among the new defects to identify process paths that lead to such defects [ 11].

Finally, unlike known defect patterns that have already been directly inspected by engineers and assigned labels, these new defect patterns lack label infor - mation [6 , 9]. Ultimately, the timely detection of new defect patterns and the simultaneous clustering of multiple defect patterns are highly important for preventing major quality accidents in the semiconductor industry. Therefore, for the automatic classification of WBM defects, it is important to develop methods that can detect and classify novel defects without labels. However, previous studies on WBM analy - sis are limited to classifying known patterns using labels or detecting the existence of a new defect pattern [1, 5, 6, 8, 9]. Existing WBM studies focus on enhancing the performance of known defective patterns, even when using unlabeled data [8].

In this situation, deep clustering techniques, commonly used in computer vision, can effectively identity and clas- sify new patterns. Deep clustering groups similar patterns based on image features, without using labels, enabling the classification of patterns with different characteristics [12, 13]. Deep clustering uses a deep learning model to extract features from unlabeled images and subsequently conducts clustering. During this process, the clustering performance is enhanced by learning to group similar images together while distinguishing those with different characteristics.

In this study, we propose the contrastive deep clustering (CODEC) for wafer bin maps that combines deep clustering with contrastive learning to enhance the classifying perfor - mance of very few new patterns [14, 15]. Our methodology extends the work of Huang et al. (2022), which used two different loss functions to train a deep clustering model [16].

In this study, we propose a CODEC that can accurately classify multiple new patterns by effectively solving the problems caused by the similarity between WBM classes and the scar - city of new pattern data. 2.2 Deep clustering Deep clustering methods extract vectors that summarizes the high-dimensional data such as image data using deep learning algorithms [25].

To make this determination, we calculate the median of the logit vector for each class. Next, we compute the distance between this median and all data points within the corresponding class. These distances are then sorted by class. To establish a ref- erence distance, we identify any distance that exceeds 70% from the center.

The proposed CODEC aims to cluster and differentiate multiple new defect patterns in the WBM process of the semiconductor industry. An overview of the CODEC method is presented in Fig. 2. The loss function used in CODEC builds upon the ProPos method, which has demonstrated superior performance among deep clustering methods for general image data [ 16]. The ProPos loss function combines two components: the prototype scattering loss (PSL) and positive sampling alignment (PSA), both of which contrib- ute to improving clustering performance. The PSL encour - ages the centers of different clusters to be more distant from each other while ensuring that the calculated centroids of the same cluster, as derived from the query encoder and key encoder, learn to be close to each other. Concurrently, the PSA enables samples with similar characteristics to cluster together. However, the effectiveness of the ProPos algorithm on new and rare defect patterns in WBM, which are inher - ently scarce, may not be optimal.

The PSA loss function, as depicted in Eq. 5, calculates the mean squared error loss between the vector generated by the predictor in the overall model architecture and the vector produced by the target network. Notably, these vectors represent augmented versions of the same source image. By minimizing the PSA loss, the model learns representations that encourage samples with simi- lar attributes to cluster together in the embedding space.

The contrastive learning process, illustrated in Fig. 3, involves a query encoder and a key encoder. Pairs of data obtained through two different augmentations of the same sample are designated as positive pairs. One pair is pro- cessed by the query encoder to generate a query vector, and the other pair is fed into the key encoder to generate a posi- tive key. Furthermore, a subset of the remaining samples is selected as negative samples, and their representations are computed using the key encoder. These representations are stored in a dictionary of negative keys.

The dataset comprises a total of 811,457 WBMs, out of which 172,950 WBMs have labeled data. To focus on classifying new defect patterns, we exclude the “none” class that represents samples without a specific pattern. We also exclude the “near-full” class, which closely resembles the random class and lacks meaningful patterns. Our experiment involves seven defect patterns: edge-ring, edge-loc, center, loc, scratch, random, and donut. Because the WBM data represent categorical information, where values of zero, one, or two indicate the background or defect status for each chip, we preprocess the data into a one-hot vector representation. Furthermore, we standardize the sample size to 32 × 32 pixels to ensure (7) Lc=−logexp(q∙k+∕/u1D70F) exp(q∙k+∕/u1D70F"}

The aim of this study is to achieve accurate classification performance despite the limited availability of new defect pattern data in the semiconductor industry. To simulate this scenario, we sample 3%, 4%, and 5% of the total data for known defect patterns to represent the quantity of new defect pattern data. Furthermore, we establish four different scenarios to simulate various combinations of new defect patterns encountered in real-world situations. In Scenario A, the selected new patterns are scratch, donut, and random. Scenario B includes loc, scratch, and random as new pat- terns. For Scenario C, we choose center, edge-loc, and loc as new patterns, a"}

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the results, each method was tested five times across differ - ent scenarios, with the seed value varied for each run. This variability in the seed value helps account for any potential bias introduced by the random initialization of the model. The hyperparameters /u1D6FCpsl and /u1D6FCpsa in the loss function of the proposed CODEC were matched with those used in the ProPos study [16]. Additionally, the hyperparameter /u1D6FCc was set to 0.1 to balance the contribution of the contrastive loss component. For evaluation, we used the accuracy metric, which is widely used in multiclass classification problems.

The average accu- racy for known classes and the accuracy for new classes in each scenario exceeded 0.6, indicating the initial success of the conventional CNN model in distinguishing between known and new patterns. This step is crucial because it iso- lates the new patterns for further analysis using CODEC. Table 3 provides insights into the quantity of data classified as unknown. As the sampling ratio decreases from 0.05 to 0.03, the volume of data per scenario also decreases. This reduction in data quantity aligns with the nature of WBM data, where new patterns are relatively rare. Hence, Table 2 and 3 collectively demonstrate that the experimental setup is appropriately configured for the classification of minority novel patterns, taking into account the scarcity of such pat- terns in the WBM data.

This study has highlighted the significance of timely identification and resolution of these new patterns. By effectively applying the contrastive loss method, we have demonstrated the capability to classify new patterns even when the number of samples per class is limited.

This research marks a pioneering applica- tion of deep clustering, a commonly used method in general image analysis, to the specific domain of WBM data. Lev - eraging the WM-811 K open dataset, we have successfully showcased the feasibility of classifying emerging patterns, even with a scarcity of samples. Specifically, our proposed CODEC algorithms showcase enhanced classification of a limited number of new patterns through the application of the contrastive loss. This enhancement is attributed to the reduced probability of selecting a small set of new pattern data as the negative sample. As a result, when compared to established deep clustering methods, we provide both quan- titative and qualitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach in effectively distinguishing and classifying each minority new pattern.

In our future studies, we plan to investigate techniques that can enhance the selection of negative samples for improved identification and categorization of novel pat - terns. Currently, the contrastive loss function considers all samples, excluding the input data itself, as potential negative samples. However, this approach has limitations because the negative samples may still include data from the same class as the input, which can hinder accurate clas- sification. To address this limitation, we intend to develop a strategy for selecting negative samples that possess Table 4 Accuracy of the predicted unknown class by methodology and sampling ratio (For each sampling ratio, the accuracy of the best-performing deep clustering method in each scenario is highlighted in bold, and the value in parentheses represents the standard deviatio"}

The contrastive loss function becomes meaningful when data points with different labels but close distances in the embedding space are separated. Therefore, we aim to approach this by generating pseudo-labels based on deep clustering. Initially, we intend to select data with different pseudo-labels and then calculate the similarity to desig- nate data within a certain distance as negative samples. By incorporating this refined selection method into the con- trastive loss function, we anticipate an enhanced ability to identify and classify unfamiliar patterns. This approach will enable the model to focus on learning discriminative features that differentiate between the input data and nega- tive samples, leading to improved performance in detect- ing and categorizing novel patterns.

Introduction The production of semiconductor devices is a complex and highly detailed operation, involving hundreds of steps to fabricate integrated circuit (IC) chips on silicon wafers. After wafer fabrication, the wafer needs to be inspected. Common inspection methods include a probing test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron mi- croscopy (TEM), X-ray inspection, and automatic optical inspection (AOI), each generating information at different levels. For probing tests, the electrical performance of each die is tested using wafer probes. Dies that meet quality requirements are cut off from the wafer and utilized as final qualified chips. As the worldwide need for these devices grows, manufacturers are concentrating their efforts on boosting manufacturing efficiency by employing techniques such as maximizing the number of chips per wafer. Nevertheless, the enhanced complexity of the"}

Nevertheless, the enhanced complexity of these advanced techniques also gives rise to various defects, which are inevitable during the manufacturing processes. Therefore, the results of wafer test are stored in wafer bin maps (WBMs) for defect analysis, contributing to reducing defect rates and ensuring market competitiveness [1]. WBM defect pattern recognition is crucial for detecting systemic manufacturing is- sues, as the accurate classification and segmentation results of WBM defect patterns can effectively infer the root causes of defects in the manufacturing process [ 2].

As shown in Figure 1a, the typical single defect patterns contain the following: “Center”, “Donut”, “EdgeLoc”, “EdgeRing”, “Loc”, “NearFull”, “Scratch”, and “Random” [ 3]. With the ongoing advancement in the IC industry, the complexity of manufacturing raises the likelihood of mixed-type WBM defect patterns appearing on the same wafer [ 4,5], as shown in Figure 1b. These defect patterns may interact with each other, resulting in more intricate issues. Consequently, accurate classification and segmentation of these mixed-type WBM defect patterns are essential for effective quality control. Figure 1. (a) Eight common single-type WBM defect patterns.

Recent studies have explored the application of artificial intelligence and computer vision models for defect pattern analysis [ 2]. However, existing research mainly focuses on image classification and cannot accurately identify the size and location of mixed-type defect patterns. In addition, training a model to recognize defect patterns often requires a large number of labeled samples and undoubtedly wastes manpower and resources. Self-supervised learning can learn from unlabeled data, which is particularly attractive in situations where it is difficult to obtain large amounts of labeled data [ 7]. Although self-supervised learning is currently mainly used for image classification tasks, our work is based on the intuition that the WBM defect pattern segmentation can also benefit from representations learned through self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. This study centers on contrastive learning, a branch of self-supervised learning [ 8,9].

According to our research, most existing contrastive learning approaches prioritize global representations, which are not optimal for segmentation tasks that require pixel-level distinctions [ 10]. If local regions of images are extracted for contrastive learning, then local representations can be adequately learned [ 11] for segmentation tasks. Consequently, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning model that integrates both global and local contrastive learning modules, with queue mechanisms introduced to decouple the sample size from mini-batch constraints. Specifically, the global contrastive learning module focuses on the learning of global representations, while the local contrastive learning Sensors 2025 ,25, 1272 3 of 18 module is used to learn pixel-level discrimination. With the introduction of queues, each module receives a sufficient number of negative samples, improving the contrastive loss computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of contrastive learning to both the classification and segmentation of WBM defect patterns.

Related Works 2.1. WBM Defect Pattern Recognition WBM defect pattern analysis is crucial for identifying the root cause of process failures in semiconductor manufacturing. The current research mainly focuses on the classification of single defect patterns and can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category mainly monitors defect patterns on WBMs by constructing statistical information [12,13] , which can successfully separate normal and abnormal graphic patterns, but it is difficult to distinguish different defect patterns. The second category is model-based clustering meth- ods. For example, Wang et al. [ 14] used Gaussian EM to detect elliptical and linear patterns and used the shell algorithm to estimate annular patterns. Yuan and Kuo [ 15] proposed a mixed model describing the distribution of defects and used Bayesian inference to estimate parameters.

Overview In this paper, we propose a classification and segmentation model for mixed-type WBM defect patterns based on self-supervised contrastive learning. In our problem setting, we consider a set of WBM data including Nlabeled data and Munlabeled data, where N≪M. For simplicity, the unlabeled set is defined as Du={xi}M i=1, and the labeled set is defined as Dl={xi,yi}M+N i=M+1. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of a self- supervised pre-training stage and a supervised fine-tuning stage.

A query can be understood as the target to be searched for, and a key is the template. The model is built by matching the query to a dictionary of keys, which is a queue of the encoded representations of data samples that is updated with each mini-batch.

Data Augmentation In contrastive learning, the model is trained by enforcing similarity between positive sample pairs and dissimilarity between negative sample pairs. Therefore, the core of con- trastive learning is the construction of positive and negative samples. In practice, different augmented views of the same sample after data augmentation are seen as positive samples, while other samples are defined as negative samples. Supported by data augmentation, the model can learn better feature representations of the data, capture the fundamental Sensors 2025 ,25, 1272 6 of 18 structure and relationships between samples, and effectively prevent over-fitting.

Furthermore, the global queue that is a unique form of a linear list for dynamically managing vectors is introduced, as shown in Figure 3. Since the core of contrastive learn- ing is to construct sufficient negative sample pairs, we design the global queue to store abundant negative vectors (i.e., key features) generated by the key encoder.

The size of key features in the global queue can far exceed the capacity of a single batch, which can increase the diversity of training and improve the generalization ability of the model. Therefore, the introduction of the queue can decouple the negative vector size from the mini-batch size. In the dynamic management of the global queue, the current mini-batch of encoded key features is enqueued into the queue and the oldest key features are dequeued from the queue. This process ensures that the model is always learning from the latest data by a dynamic and efficient management of key features. 3.3.2. Global Contrastive Loss Global contrastive loss is a measure of the similarities between global features in a representation space and promotes the model to learn global representations. In contrastive learning, if a query feature (generated by query encoder) is given, only a unique key feature in the global queue can match it. So, the idea of contrastive learning is to compare the query feature with all the key features in the queue and hope that the query feature is as similar as possible to its matching key feature, and t"}

Obviously, there is a single key feature (denoted asgI i) that matches gII i. Then, the contrastive loss function, called InfoNCE [ 30], is used to expect matching pairs to be similar and mismatching pairs to be dissimilar, as follows: LG=1 NGNG ∑ i=1−logexp\u0000 gII i·gI i/τg\u0001 ∑K k=0exp\u0000 gII i·gI k/τg\u0001, (4) where τgis a temperature hyper-parameter, and NGdenotes the number of samples from a mini-batch.

Local Contrastive Learning Module The local contrastive learning module is a local contrastive representation space for computing the contrastive loss associated with the local regions of a WBM. For a WBM with mixed-type defect patterns, the segmentation task is more complex due to the inter- connected nature of defects and their variability in quantity, position, and type, etc. While global features can effectively capture the overall information of an image, relying solely on global features to measure WBM defect patterns will result in the neglect of crucial local details. This approach may not be optimal for segmentation tasks that require pixel-level discrimination. To address this issue, we design the local contrastive learning module to Sensors 2025 ,25, 1272 8 of 18 learn the representation of local regions.

Local Region Selection and Matching Randomly selected local regions will be biased towards the more dominant feature categories, as the “background” category accounts for a large proportion in mixed-type WBM defect patterns. Therefore, we need to make the selection of local regions reasonable to contain more valuable feature categories. For example, as shown in Figure 5, flipping and rotating operations are performed on xi, and two augmented views xI iandxII iare obtained respectively. The selected local regions are then matched according to their positions. Figure 5. Process of local region selection and matching.

Specifically, xI iis input into the convolutional layer, and the weight of each local region is calculated and recorded by sliding the kernel. We select the local region with the maximum weight from xI i, and then the position of the matching local region in xII iis determined. To minimize overlap, after each local region selection, the region is excluded so that the centers of subsequently selected regions do not fall into the previously selected local regions. This weighted selection and matching process is repeated nrtimes, selecting distinct local regions in each iteration to obtain nr pairs of matched local regions from images xI iandxII i. 3.4.2.

Although using queues allows for the size of negative vectors to be larger, it also poses difficulties for updating the key encoder and key decoder via back-propagation, since the gradient should propagate to all samples in the queue. To address this issue, a momentum update approach is utilized for the key encoder and decoder, which accumulates exponen- tial moving averages of the key network to ensure a stable and efficient update manner. To be specific, the query encoder parameters θeqand the decoder parameters θdqare updated via back-propagation"}

The momentum updating makes parameters θekandθdkevolve more smoothly than θeqandθdq. Therefore, although the keys in the queue are generated by different encoders and decoders, the differences between these encoders and decoders can be ignored. 3.5.2.

In our problem, given labeled data {xi,yi} ∈Dl, we fine-tune the whole network through a segmentation loss LSand classification loss LC. For the computation of the segmentation loss LS, we employ the cross-entropy loss function [ 31], which computes the pixel-level difference between segmented defect patterns and the ground truth. However, merely calculating the loss value of pixels may result in over-segmentation. It is still necessary to compute the loss value associated with the type of defect. We use a C-bit one-hot value to represent the predicted types of WBM defect patterns and calculate the corresponding binary cross entropy loss LC. Since we need to simultaneously focus on the classification and segmentation of WBM defect patterns, the total loss function in the fine-tuning period is defined as follows: LF=λ2LS+ (1−λ2)LC, (11) where LSrepresents the segmentation loss and LCrepresents the classification loss. 4.

Experimental Results 4.1. Data Description A wafer bin map (WBM) is the result of the circuit probing process, recording the spatial distribution of defective chips on the wafer. The WBMs dataset collection system is shown in Figure 6. The primary method of wafer testing involves the coordination between the tester and the probe stage [ 32]. During the testing process, the tester cannot directly measure the wafer under test. Instead, it relies on the probes in the probe card to make electrical contact with the pads or bumps on the wafer. The test signals measured by the probes are then sent to the automatic test equipment (ATE) for analysis and judgment, thereby obtaining the electrical characteristics test results for each die on the wafer. All samples are collected in actual industrial scenarios by the wafer probe testing station. We standardized the image size to 52 ×52. Figure 6. Wafer probe testing station.

It is worth noting that Random and NearFull defects do not significantly point to specific manufacturing roots, and their impact in practice is minimal. Also, these two types of patterns are not suitable for generating mixed defects with other single defect patterns, so we do not consider the synthesis of these two types. Furthermore, we consider the WBMs of the normal category (C0) into the model training process, and there are 37 kinds of defect patterns and 1 kind of normal category in total.

We can see that the segmentation maps obtained using our model are smooth, complete, and robust to Sensors 2025 ,25, 1272 14 of 18 noise. Even in the cases where several mixed defect patterns are overlapped, our model can still distinguish them based on the different characteristics of each defect pattern. For all these defect patterns, the CandERclasses are best classified and segmented. This is because the location and shape of the Cand ERdefect patterns are relatively fixed and easier to distinguish. Even for the Sclass, which may easily interact with other pattern classes, our model still has an excellent segmentation performance. Therefore, our model has great potential and application value in the field of WBMs classification and segmentation. Figure 7.

These indicators are far superior to the other three self-supervised contrastive learning methods. SimCLR performs the worst, with the overall IoUandAccuracy values only being 75.85% and 80.41%. This is related to the fact that SimCLR relies more on large batch data, and the model cannot learn more useful knowledge from limited data. Although self- supervised contrastive learning is widely used in the field of image classification, research on segmentation tasks is still somewhat lacking. The other three common contrastive learning methods used for comparison only focus on global representations; thus, they ignore the local information, which is important for segmentation tasks. So, even after the fine-tuning period, their performance is still not excellent. However, our approach is designed to focus on both the global and local information of the image. Therefore, the proposed model can perform well whether the WBM defect patterns are easy or difficult to distinguish. Table 5.

Effectiveness of the Amount of Self-Supervised Unlabeled Data Self-supervised pre-training needs to use a large amount of unlabeled data, and an abundance of unlabeled WBMs is readily accessible in the industrial manufacturing pro- cess. Therefore, this section investigates the potential of more self-supervised pre-training unlabeled data improving the performance of the model. Building upon our WBM dataset, we randomly utilized 1%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% pre-training unlabeled WBMs. As pre- sented in Table 6, the horizontal axis represents different amounts of pre-training unlabeled data, while the vertical axis displays various evaluation metrics for segmentation and classification.

The experimental results indicate an overall upward trend as the amount of unlabeled data increases. This is because more unlabeled pre-training data contain richer features, so the model can learn more distinctive feature representations, thereby improving the generalization ability. Hence, it can be anticipated that the proposed method may yield even greater benefits when applied to a larger dataset for self-supervised pre-training. Table 6.

Initially, we expanded the fine-tuning labeled dataset to the same size as the pre-training unlabeled dataset. Then, we fine-tuned the model using varying proportions of labeled data, specifically 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% of the self-supervised unlabeled data. The results, presented in Table 7, indicate that as the amount of labeled fine-tuning data increased, the evaluation metrics exhibited an upward trend, although at a diminishing rate. This can be attributed to the model’s ability to learn more information with an increasing number of labels but with a diminishing rate for each additional label. When the amount of labeled data reaches 25% of the self- supervised unlabeled data, the model achieves outstanding performance, and almost all of the evaluation metrics reach a fairly satisfactory result. Therefore, our proposed self- supervised contrastive learning model is not heavily dependent on the size of the labeled data but still remains effective even when a large amount of labeled data are available.

We chose to remove one or two modules separately for experimental research. The experimental results are shown in Table 8. We present the results of the abla- tive experiments conducted to assess the effectiveness of different modules. The horizontal axis represents the evaluation metrics, while the vertical axis lists various combinations of the modules. When there is only the global contrastive learning module or only the local contrastive learning module, the performance is slightly inferior to the experimental results obtained from the complete network. This indicates that both the global information and local information are beneficial for our segmentation and recognition task from different perspectives. Therefore, when removing both the global and local modules, the model performance becomes extremely poor. The purpose of the fine-tuning module is to make the self supervised pre-trained model better adapt to the specific downstream task. Hence, when the fine-tuning module is removed, the model does not adapt well to the recognition and segmentation of mixed-type WBM defect patterns.

The experi- mental results indicate that our model surpasses other self-supervised contrastive learning approaches.

And the ablation study further assesses the contribution of each model component to the overall performance. In practical scenarios where large amounts of unlabeled WBM data can be easily obtained, our proposed model will have significant real-world applications. However, in the process of chip manufactur- ing, even minor defects can lead to chip failure or performance degradation. Therefore, the requirements for defect detection are extremely stringent. We will focus on improving the detection performance with a limited number of labeled samples. In future research, we aim to integrate network architecture optimizations with self-supervised learning to increase model evaluation accuracy, reduce processing time, and lower computational resource demands. We also plan to extend the application of our model to other fields, such as medical image segmentation and remote sensing image analysis.

However, in the real world, multiple novel patterns frequently arise that have not been previously encountered. Hence, AI models must exhibit the capacity to detect not only existing known defect patterns but also newly emerging defect patterns, while ensuring effective classiﬁcation of these newpatterns among themselves. In this study, we propose the contrastive open-world semi-supervised learning that can classify multiple novel patterns in WBMs simultaneously. We introduce a contrastive loss function to address the challenges associated with the existence of signiﬁcantly fewer new defect patterns than existing patterns in the WBM problem. We conﬁrm that theproposed methodology effectively detects and classiﬁes diverse new patterns separately in real-world open data, WM-811 K. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other existing open-world semi-supervised learning in WBM classiﬁcation.

Thus, engineers conduct an array of inspections to assess the condition of the wafers and determine whether any defects are present. For example, electrical die sorting(EDS) serves as a method of verifying the proper functioning of each chip on a wafer, yielding wafer bin map (WBM) data. A WBM constitutes a format of image data that illustratesthe position of each chip and designates its defective or non-defective status, as shown in Fig. 1. WBM patterns exhibit distinct variations depending on the underlying causes of the failure, serving as crucial indicators for estimating the originof the malfunction (Jin et al., 2020 ; Kong & Ni, 2021 ). Hence, the classiﬁcation of failure patterns in WBMs represents an essential process that serves as the foundation of yield qual-ity management. Indeed, the manual classiﬁcation of each 123 2164 Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2025) 36:2163–2175 Fig. 1 E x a m p l eo faw a f e rb i nm a p WBM, generated at high volumes, is a labor-intensive and costly endeavor for engineers, necessitating the developmentof a model capable of performing automated classiﬁcation.

However, building an automated model to classify wafer defects poses a signiﬁcant challenge because of the followingcharacteristics of WBM. First, the scarcity of labeled data for model training poses a signiﬁcant challenge (Kahng & Kim, 2021 ). Obtaining labels is costly and time-consuming because WBM generated in real industries necessitates theinvolvement of numerous specialized engineers to perform manual inspection and assign accurate labels. Moreover, maintaining a continuous labeling process for the vastamount of newly generated WBMs is nearly impossible because of accumulating tens of thousands of WBMs. There- fore, leveraging not only a limited pool of labeled data butalso a considerable amount of unlabeled data becomes nec- essary. Second, actual WBMs have the potential to produce novel failure patterns that have not been previously identi-ﬁed (Jang et al., 2020 ; Jang & Lee, 2023 ; Kong & Ni, 2021 ).

Engineers can promptly take appropriate measures when a previously known defect pattern emerges because of their accumulated experience in identifying the root cause of thedefect and taking the appropriate actions to address it. How- ever, when a novel defect pattern emerges, its root cause may not be immediately apparent. In such cases, tracing the causeof the defect is essential to mitigate the risk of potential qual- ity incidents. Hence, developing a model capable of not only classifying known patterns but also detecting diverse emerg-ing new defect patterns is necessary. Finally, although a newdefect pattern may be identiﬁed, various patterns may exist in this new defect pattern. In the semiconductor industry, identifying and categorizing new defect patterns is crucialbecause engineers group wafers with the same new pattern to ﬁnd process paths that cause defects. By tracing the root cause of the defect and implementing appropriate correc-tive measures when a defect pattern is clearly identiﬁed, it is possible to minimize the incidence of defects and prevent potential accidents from occurring. Consequently, an auto-mated mo"}

Consequently, an auto-mated model for wafer defect classiﬁcation must be capableof detecting diverse new patterns and classifying them into the appropriate categories. As shown in Fig. 2, developing a predictive model that can classify novel patterns using a signiﬁcant amount of unlabeled data is essential to achieving this goal. However, existing research on classifying WBM defect patterns has been limited to simply classifying defect pat- terns or detecting new ones (Hsu & Chien, 2022 ; Jang et al., 2020 ; Jang & Lee, 2023 ; Kahng & Kim, 2021 ; Kong & Ni, 2021 ). Therefore, in this study, we use open-world semi- supervised learning that can detect and classify new patterns by utilizing a substantial quantity of unlabeled data (Caoet al., 2021 ; Rizve et al., 2022a ,2022b ). Open-world semi- supervised learning represents an approach that amalgamates open-world recognition and semi-supervised learning.

Open-world recognition allows models to simultaneously detectand classify multiple unknown classes (Bendale & Boult, 2015 ;P a r m a re ta l . , 2023 ). This means that when a new defect pattern occurs in the WBM, it can be considered as mul-tiple unknown classes. Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data when training a model to improve prediction performance (Chapelle et al., 2009 ; V an Engelen & Hoos, 2020 ). This methodology can better reﬂect the char- acteristics of WBM data, in which a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data are collected. In this research, we proposed an approach called con- trastive open-world semi-supervised learning (CowSSL) for defect classiﬁcation of WBMs. We built upon the work of Cao et al. ( 2021 ), which used three different loss functions to train a model on an image dataset containing labeled and unlabeled data classiﬁed as new classes.

Nonetheless, the previous study exhibits limitations in demonstrating its per-formance for general image data where the number of data per class maintains balance. Our approach aims to address the challenges of extreme class imbalance in the semiconductorﬁeld, whereby the number of known pattern classes is over-whelmingly large compared to the number of new patterns that have not been identiﬁed. This often leads to overﬁtting to the overwhelmingly known classes, signiﬁcantly reducingthe performance of new pattern detection and classiﬁcation accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a con- trastive loss function to enhance the ability of the model toseparate new patterns from existing patterns and distinguish among different new patterns (Chen et al., 2020a ,2020b ;H e et al., 2020 ). As a result, we propose a methodology that is capable of detecting and classifying new patterns, even when the number of new patterns is comparably small.

The WM-811K dataset, introduced by Wuet al. ( 2015 ) is renowned for its reliability because it orig- inates from real-world fabrication processes and has been meticulously labeled by domain experts. This inspectionand labeling process is shown in Fig. 3. The WM-811K dataset has been widely used in many studies (Hsu & Chien, 2022 ; Kahng & Kim, 2021 ; Piao et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 2015 ). Among these, 172,950 wafers were annotated according todefect pattern and were leveraged for experimental valida- tion. Furthermore, we omitted the none class, which does not have any distinct pattern, from our study. The datasetcomprised eight types of patterns including center, edge- loc, edge-ring, loc, scratch, random, donut, and near-full. WBM data is classiﬁed as either ‘normal’ or ‘fail based onthe inspection of multiple chips on a single wafer.

Throughout this process, the defect patterns are categorized based on how the ’fail’ chips cluster together. These defec-tive patterns are classiﬁed by domain experts according totheir shape. For example, a ’center’ pattern indicates that defective chips are concentrated in the middle of the WBM, forming a central shape. Conversely, an ’edge-ring’ patterndescribes a form where bad chips are arranged in the shape of a ring around the outer edge of the WBM. Given that the near-full pattern is nearly identical to the random pat-tern, it is deemed unnecessary and subsequently removed in this study. Ultimately, as illustrated in Fig. 4, known patterns encompassed four classes, and new patterns composed threeclasses, namely, scratch, random, and donut.

Among variouscombinations of selecting known and unknown patters, our choice is based on industry practices in the semiconductor ﬁeld. Given the ample availability of known pattern data, weselected a sizable sample of edge-ring, edge-loc, center, and loc patterns. In contrast, because of the small amount of data for the new patterns, we selected smaller sample sizes for thescratch, random, and donut classes. To standardize the data, we initially resized each wafer to a consistent size of 32 × 32. Because the pixel value represents categorical data thatis categorized as 0 (no wafer area), 1 (good chip), and 2 (badchip), we converted it into three channels through one-hot encoding. Finally, we formed a 3 ×32×32 dimensional image serving as input data. We partitioned the total WM-811 K dataset into training and test sets, with 90% of the data used for training and the remaining 10% for testing.

This loss function aids in distinguish-ing new patterns from known patterns by using an adaptivemargin. In Eq. ( 3),¯μis calculated by taking the average of the largest probability values output by the model, sub- tracted by one. The larger the uncertainty value is, the morelikely the model is to predict multiple patterns with equal probabilities, rather than a single pattern with high probabil- ity. Ultimately, when substituting Eq. ( 3) into Eq. ( 2), if the model predicts a new pattern that differs from the known pat- tern, the probability values become more evenly distributed, causing the uncertainty to increase accordingly and enablingthe identiﬁcation of the new pattern.

This implies that the representation encourages samples with the same pattern to be clustered together through the clus-tering of close neighbors. For the unlabeled data, the loss function is calculated based on the nearest sample.

The MoCo algorithm is one of the self-supervised learning methods that uses a contrastive losswith negative samples. This approach facilitates the learningof the features of input data without relying on labels. As the learning progresses, samples with similar features in thefeature space tend to be together, while samples with dissim- ilar features tend to move farther apart. As shown in Fig. 6, the contrastive loss function performs contrastive learningby employing a query encoder and a key encoder. In thisprocess, data that has undergone two augmentations on the same sample is placed into positive pairs. One of these pairs is input to the query encoder to create a query vector, andthe other is fed into the key encoder to generate a positive key.

An important aspect to note here is that the negative sample selection comes from all other samples, excluding the sample itself, which has undergone different augmenta-tions. Consequently, data from a new class containing a small number of samples are less likely to be selected as a negative sample, whereas data from a known class containing a largenumber of samples are more likely to be chosen as a negative sample. Therefore, the majority class (known class) is more likely to be selected as a negative sample and is further dis-tanced from the minority class (new class), thereby increasingthe probability of separation between the two classes.

Figure 7displays a representation of the OpenLDN, TRSSL, ORCA, and CowSSL models through t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) analysis. t-SNE is a methodology used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data to facilitate the visualization.

This method learns the bufferlocations with a Sobol sequence iteratively and reduces the bufferranges afterward with tuning concentration and buffer grouping.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method canachieve a proﬁt improvement of about 14% on average and upto 26%, with only a small number of tuning buffers inserted intothe circuit.

With the knowl- edge of the distributions of process variations, SSTA methods produce a performance-yield curve with which designers have a chance to make a tradeoff between different design goals.To alleviate the effect of process variations, many researchers have also worked on circuit structure level to introduce special devices and mechanisms.

For instance, the Razor method [ 3] boosts circuit performance up to the limit where timing errors occur during circuit operation. Another technique to counter process variations is to use post-silicon tuning devices to adaptchips individually according to the effect of process variations after manufacturing. A widely used post-silicon tuning technique is clock tun- ing with delay buffers. For example, the structure of the delay buffer used in [ 4] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The delay of this buffer can be changed by setting the conﬁguration bits in the three registers. In high-performance designs, tuning buffers like this are inserted during the design phase. After manu-facturing, the delay values of these buffers are conﬁgured to allot critical paths more timing budget by shifting clock edges toward the stages with smaller combinational delays. Thesecritical paths might be different in individual chips due to process variations, so that only post-silicon tuning can coun- terbalance them efﬁciently.

For an individual chip, this post-silicon clock tuning is similar to the concept of useful clock skews [ 19].

This way, the number of buffers can be reduced by one, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Furthermore, we can reduce the number of buffers even to two, if we can move the clock edge at F2 2.5 time units earlier, so that the timing slack of the path betweenF1 and F2 can be shifted to the path between F2 and F3 directly, as in Fig. 2(c). This negative delay can be imple- mented by shortening the original clock path in advance tointroduce a negative delay in reference to the predeﬁned arrival time of clock signals.

III. P ROBLEM FORMULATION In applying the post-silicon tuning technique, we need to insert the buffers after logic synthesis is ﬁnished and before physical design is started. Since buffers take precious die area, and require additional test to conﬁgure them, the num- ber of buffers in a design should be limited. In addition, theranges of the buffers should be reduced as much as possi- ble.

Reducing the Number of Emulation Samples Using Low-Discrepancy Sequence The sampling-based concept above requires a large num- ber of samples to guarantee the quality of the resulting buffer locations. Consider the extreme case where we use only twosamples, which have different probabilities to appear in the manufactured chips. In the formulation ( 16), (17), however, we do not differentiate these two samples with respect to theirprobabilities so that the two samples have the same inﬂuence on the selection of buffers. Consequently, the formulation loses accuracy because the calculated optimal proﬁt deviates fromthe real proﬁt.

The effect of probability can thus be handled by (16) and ( 17) implicitly, because samples from regions with large probabilities in the problem space appear more often than samples from other regions. Another way to solve this discrepancy problem is to use the probability of representa-tive samples as further coefﬁcients of the yield values in the objective ( 16) directly. But it is not clear how many samples should be generated to guarantee the quality of the result. The third method to solve the problem of a large sampling number is to use a low-discrepancy sequence such as stud- ied in [ 27].

The yield value of a circuit in abin is the number of samples in that bin divided by 10 000. The samples in our experiments are conceptually different from the samples discussed in Section IV, because they were only used to emulate post-silicon measurements. For each sample, we verify whether a chip can be assigned into a bin by solving the classical skew scheduling problem in [ 19]. In reality, the delays and timing properties cannot be measured exactly from the manufactured chips, so that the actual yield is slightly smaller than the reported yield, as discussed in [ 21].

Moreover, meaningful defect patterns for di- agnostics are retained through the engineers ’ involvement in the development procedure. 1.Introduction The semiconductor manufacturing process comprises several hun- dred steps to fabricate hundreds to thousands of chips on a wafer. After the wafer fabrication, electrical probe tests are conducted to determine whether a chip has the proper quality for a packaging process. Defective chips (referred to as defects) fail at least one of the probe tests. The test results are recorded by the binary bin code, which expresses whether a chip is functional or defective [1], or by the categorical bin code, which expresses the type of failed tests [2]. A wafer bin map (WBM) arranges the position of chips and their bin codes to represent the probe test re- sults of a wafer. A WBM may comprise random defects, non-random defects, or both. Determining whether a given defect (i.e., a specific defect) is a random or non-random defect is generally impossible due to the large number of chips on a wafer and the various factors influencing chip quality throughout the wafer fabrication process [3]. However, in the literature, if a group"}

However, in the literature, if a group of defects exhibits a spatial correlation on the WBM, the de- fects are attributed to an assignable cause and categorized as non- random defects [4]. For instance, line-shaped and circle-shaped de- fects are attributed to the hardening of the pad and the non-uniformity problem during chemical –mechanical planarization, respectively [5]. On the other hand, defects that are randomly distributed on a WBM without a spatial correlation are considered random defects. The types of spatial correlation among defects are referred to as defect patterns. They manifest themselves in various forms, such as a Line, Circle , and Ring [6]. The relationship between the wafer fabrication failure and defect patterns is identified through manual monitoring [7], statistical analysis [8], pattern mining [9], and rule-based inference [10].

The performance of the models heavily depends on the quality of input data [18,19] ; thus, the acquisition of a coherently classified WBM dataset is important. A defect pattern taxonomy refers to a set of predefined defect pat- terns, and a WBM dataset is commonly classified using the taxonomy in practice. For instance, non-random defects in the WM811K dataset [20] are classified as one of the nine defect patterns of the WM811K taxon - omy, namely, Center, Donut, Location, Edge-Loc, Edge-Ring, Scratch, Random, None, and Near-Full . Fig. 1 depicts the WM811K taxonomy, where functional and defective chips are indicated in gray and white colors, respectively. As mentioned earlier, a WBM can be represented using either the binary bin code or the categorical bin code. However, in the literature, defect pattern taxonomies have been developed predominantly for the case of binary bin code. This is because a defect pattern taxonomy aims to classify defect patterns based solely on the spatial features of defects [21–23], where the binary bin code proves sufficient for representing these spatial features.

Moreover, a WBM with the categorical bin code can be easily transformed into one with the binary bin code [24]. Hence, without the loss of generality, this study assumes that the WBM com- prises the binary bin code. A poorly defined defect pattern taxonomy is one of the reasons for incoherent classification [1,25] . For coherent classification, the defect pattern taxonomy should possess three desirable properties of a general taxonomy, namely, robustness, comprehensiveness, and extendibility [26]. The robustness refers to a clear differentiation between the defect patterns. Accurately classifying spatial correlations requires differenti - ation criteria that facilitate clear differentiation between defect patterns. The comprehensiveness means that defect patterns are sufficiently defined to classify spatial correlations among defects in the WBM dataset.

When defects show spatial correlations not defined in a defect pattern taxonomy, there is a risk of neglecting these spatial correlations during diagnostics or misclassifying them as a different defect pattern within the taxonomy. This may lead to inaccurate identification of the root cause [27]. The extendibility means the capability to add newly- emerged defect patterns in the future. A new defect pattern may indi- cate a previously unidentified root cause of wafer fabrication failure that requires investigation [9]. Consequently, the defect pattern taxonomy should be adaptable to include new patterns, facilitating ongoing root cause analysis in the wafer fabrication process. Data quality has grown to prominence in smart manufacturing sys- tems [28], and previous studies assume that the WBM dataset is coherently classified.

The research gap between the acquisition of a coherently classified WBM dataset and defect pattern classification lies in the absence of a defect pattern taxonomy that possesses all three desirable properties. This paper presents the concept and a development procedure of a spatial-dimension-based WBM taxonomy that possesses the three desirable properties of a general taxonomy and integrates domain expertise. The proposed taxonomy comprises three spatial dimensions, namely, Shape , Size, and Location. The dimension levels represent the spatial features of the defects in each dimension. Defect patterns are defined by the combination of dimension levels of the three spatial di- mensions. The robustness, comprehensiveness, and extendibility are possessed through the methodical definition of defect patterns on the three-dimensional structure.

The proposed taxonomy is validated through manual and automatic defect pattern classification in Section 4. Finally, concluding remarks and future research issues are discussed in Section 5. 2.Literature review The taxonomies developed in the early stages of defect pattern classification studies comprise only a few defect patterns. For instance, Cunningham and MacKinnon [4] defined only one defect pattern, Scratch . Chih-Hsuan Wang et al. [29] considered three defect patterns: Zone, Line, and Ring. Line corresponds to Scratch in Cunningham and MacKinnon [4] taxonomy. Similar taxonomies were proposed in other studies [9,30 –36]. The taxonomies in the aforementioned category effectively classify a few defect patterns. However, the spatial correlation within defects becomes complicated because the wafer size is enlarged, and the chip size is decreased [25]"}

However, the spatial correlation within defects becomes complicated because the wafer size is enlarged, and the chip size is decreased [25]. Thus, the taxonomies in modern wafer fabrication processes are extended to accommodate more complicated defect pat- terns through two approaches. These two approaches will henceforth be referred to as ‘pattern subdivision ’ and ‘pattern addition ’. One defect pattern may be related to several root causes [8,37] , and the pattern subdivision approach mitigated such relationships by sub- dividing the existing defect pattern into more detailed ones. For instance, Chen and Liu [38] subdivided ring-shaped and scratch-shaped defect patterns; ring-shaped defect patterns were subdivided in accor - dance with the distance from the wafer center and scratch-shaped defect patterns were subdivided by their location. Bae et al. [39] subdivided scattered-shaped defect patterns by their location, namely, random scattering , radial scattering , and scattering in one corner .

However, it has the disadvantage of limiting the taxonomy ’s comprehensiveness, as pattern subdivision can only extend the taxonomy based on existing defect patterns. For instance, the taxonomy introduced in Chen and Liu [38] cannot accommodate scattered-shaped defect patterns through subdivision because only ring- and scratch-shaped defect patterns exis- ted in the taxonomy from the beginning. The extendibility of the tax- onomy is limited in that this approach only allows the subdivision of existing defect patterns. In order to accommodate a newly-emerged defect pattern, the pattern addition approach added a newly-emerged defect pattern to an existing defect pattern taxonomy [41–49]. For instance, Hat pattern (Fig. 2-(a)) was added in Cheng et al. [50], Ooi et al. [49], and Ooi et al. [45], and Checker-board (Fig. 2-(b)) was added "}

Hsu and Chien [43] to distinguish new defect patterns from existing defect patterns (i.e., Ring, Line, and Zone). The addition of a new defect pattern can accommodate newly-emerged defect patterns, wherein the comprehensiveness and extendibility are possessed. However, the pattern addition approach has the disadvantage of compromising the taxonomy ’s robustness. Adding a new defect pattern in an ad hoc manner may lead to inconsistent differentiation criteria between defect patterns, resulting in unclear differentiation between defect patterns. For example, in the WM811K taxonomy, Donut indicates a shape of defect pattern, while Center indicates a location of defect pattern. Thus, the donut-shaped defects in the center location can be classified as one of the two defect patterns depending on the engineer ’s subjective judgment.

The WBM dataset comprises 1793 WBMs, each consisting of approximately 500 chips, manufactured in 2020. Each chip ’s binary bin codes and x- and y- positions on a WBM (integer, 0C252) are recorded in the dataset, along with the wafer ID. The WBM size is identical at 26 ×26, in which a 26 ×26 matrix is made for each wafer; the row and column of matrix correspond to the y-axis and x-axis of WBM, respectively. The matrices were converted into black-and-white images for manual inspection. Inspired by the general taxonomy development procedure proposed by Nickerson et al. [26], the two-stage procedure is proposed. In Stage 1, spatial dimensions and their dimension levels are defined. Spatial fea- tures of non-random defects are extracted from a thorough review of existing defect pattern taxonomies as well as a real WBM dataset. The features extracted are then organized into dimensions and levels within those dimensions. In Stage 2, defect patterns for the taxonomy are defined by combining the dimension levels.

In Stage 2, defect patterns for the taxonomy are defined by combining the dimension levels. Some defect patterns are merged or removed so that only meaningful defect patterns for diag- nosing wafer fabrication failures are retained. Three practicing engineers, each with over five years of experience in wafer quality monitoring and control, were involved in the taxonomy development procedure. They played a crucial role in Stages 1 and 2. In Stage 1, the engineers assisted in deciding whether to merge or subdi - vide dimension levels. They also contributed to establishing differenti - ation criteria between these levels. In Stage 2, their involvement extended to screening dimension level combinations, identifying those sharing the same root cause and removing irrelevant combinations. The engineers ’ involvement has been essential, integrating domain expertise to ensure the proposed taxonomy is both practically meaningful and effective. 3.1.

In manual vi- sual inspection of WBM, various spatial features such as shape, size, location, color, and orientation can be used to analyze non-random defects [4,31,32,38,42,51,52] . However, in the context of defect pattern taxonomy, color and orientation have been rarely considered. Color is not used because defect pattern taxonomies typically employ the binary bin code, as mentioned in Section 1. Orientation is disregarded because the same defect patterns with different orientations (i.e., rotation-variant defect patterns) are known to be associated with the identical wafer fabrication failure [33]. Therefore, the shape, size, and location are considered to be sufficient in defining the meaningful spatial dimensions of defect patterns. Thus, the proposed taxonomy is developed based on the dimensions of shape, size, and location. The Shape dimension manifests the form of a defect pattern, such"}

The Size dimension is a scale indicator of the shape, so Size manifests itself in conjunction with Shape . For instance, length is a size measurement of a scratch shape. The Location dimension indicates the site of a defect pattern on a WBM. Dimension levels represent the spatial feature of the defect patterns in each dimension. Dimension levels were defined on the basis of spatial features from the collected WBM dataset for each dimension. The spatial features of each dimension are identified and subsequently organized into dimension levels.

These criteria can be defined either by a relative scale, such as the percentage of total chips on a wafer [43], or by a physical scale, such as the length measured in centimeters [38]. The levels of the Shape dimension are Scratch , Cluster , Ring, and Random . They represent the defect patterns ’ forms, as indicated in those names. Scratch and Cluster were differentiated on the basis of the defect pattern ’s maximum width. The pattern is classified as Scratch when the maximum width is four chips. Otherwise, the pattern is classified as Cluster . The engineers determined the threshold level (i.e., four chips) because the scratch-shaped pattern was attributed to the physical damage during the wafer fabrication. Thus, its width is generally lower than the four chips. Similar to taxonomies found in [20,36,42,44] , the proposed taxonomy incorporates the “Random ” level in the Shape dimension to characterize the defect pattern of a WBM without spatial correlation among defects. The levels of the Size dimension were defined in conjunction with the shape of the defect pattern. The levels of the Size d"}

The pattern is defined as Cluster-Big if the defect pattern comprises more than 40 chips and defined as Cluster-Small otherwise. The threshold level was determined at 40 chips, which is approximately 8 % of the total number of chips in a wafer, because the engineers believe that a cluster of more than 40 defective chips may degrade the wafer ’s overall quality. Similarly, the threshold for the Size dimension in the Random pattern was set at 150 chips, approximately 30 % of the total number of chips in a wafer. The threshold between Scratch-Long and Scratch-Short was determined at 10 chips, approxi - mately 75 % of the wafer ’s radius. This decision took into account the rotation of the wafer during fabrication, which contributes to the for- mation of line-shaped defect pattern.

The WM811K taxonomy was selected for the benchmark taxonomy. The WM811K taxonomy is the most widely employed taxonomy for the validation of automatic defect pattern classification models [1,14 –16,20,37,53 –58]. Also, the WM811K taxonomy is the only taxonomy that is provided with a sub- stantial labeled WBM dataset [20], which can be served as a reference for manual classification. The WBM dataset used in this section consists of 3,209 WBMs of NAND flash memory product family. The data format and WBM size were identical to those used in the Section 3. 4.1. Assessment of the robustness and the comprehensiveness The robustness and comprehensiveness of the proposed taxonomy were assessed through manual classification in this section. Two raters independently classified the same WBM dataset using the proposed and WM811K taxonomies. Th"}

Two raters independently classified the same WBM dataset using the proposed and WM811K taxonomies. The classification coherence between the raters was compared, and the incoherent classification results were reviewed to assess the robustness. Then, the number of WBMs classified as defect patterns without spatial correlation among defects (i.e., Random –Infrequent –Scattered and None) in each taxonomy was compared to assess the comprehensiveness. A WBM is classified as them when the taxonomy cannot represent the spatial correlation among defects on a WBM. Thus, the number of WBMs classified as random defects is pre- sumed to be an indicator of the comprehensiveness. First, the inter-rater agreement was better in the proposed taxonomy. The inter –rater agreement was assessed by proportion agreement and Cohen ’s Kappa [59]. A proportion agreement is a proportion of WBMs that two raters classified as the same defect pattern.

The inter-rater agreement is considered better as the pro- portion agreement and the Kappa value approaches 100 % and 1, respectively, in our context. Table 5 shows the inter-rater agreement results. Both indices were higher in the proposed taxonomy, which in- dicates that the two raters had more consistent differentiation results in the proposed taxonomy. Second, a review of the disagreement WBMs revealed that the dif- ferentiation criteria were clearer in the proposed taxonomy. Proportions of disagreements were 20.2 % and 34.7 % in the proposed and WBM taxonomies, respectively (Table 5), and the disagreement WBMs were reconciled to confirm the defect pattern.

A new technology for wafer fabrication was adopted in 2021, and new defect patterns emerged since then. The defect pattern classification system cannot classify the newly-emerged patterns. Thus, the proposed taxonomy was extended to accommodate them. Two types of new defect patterns were derived from the unclassified WBMs. Fig. 5 illustrates the Type 1 defect pattern. The spatial features of Type 1 were identified in accordance with the three dimensions and compared with the existing dimension levels. The spatial features of Type 1 were mapped to existing dimension levels: Ring for Shape , Three- quarters for Size, and Others for the Location dimension. The combination of the three levels had been removed in the second stage of the devel - opment procedure. However, the Ring –Three-quarters –Others pattern was added, given that a new defect pattern occurred. Fig. 6 illustrates the Type 2 defect pattern.

The dimension level of Location was defined as the existing level Center , and a new dimension level, namely, Double-cluster , for the Shape dimension was defined. Given that the Size variation of Double-cluster was undetected in the dataset, a single level of All was defined in Size. Combining the dimension levels, the Double-cluster –All–Center pattern was added. Double-cluster was consequently added in the Shape dimension, and two defect patterns were added to the existing taxonomy. Newly- observed spatial features were identified and added to the dimension levels; thus, the extendibility of the proposed taxonomy was realized. 4.3. Assessment of the classification coherence The coherence of manual classification was assessed using the clas- sification models in this section.

However, denoising was not used in this study, as the two taxonomies define defect patterns for WBMs lacking spatial correlation among defects. For each wafer matrix, each chip was assigned 0 for the non-wafer area, 0.5 for functional chips, and 1 for defective chips, and zero padding was not used. A convolutional neural network (CNN) [62] was utilized for the classification model in the experiments. The CNN model has an advan - tage over other alternative feature extraction-based methods in that it directly extracts the spatial features of defect patterns from WBM images [13]. Thus, the classification performance of different taxonomies can be clearly compared using the CNN model.

However, a simpler architecture was used because the WBM size was smaller in our dataset. The CNN architecture used in this study is depicted in Fig. 7. Two convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers (“Conv ” and “FC” in Fig. 7, respectively) constituted the CNN architecture.

Defect patterns with less than 50 WBMs were removed from the dataset because the classification model hardly extracts spatial features from defect patterns with such small sample sizes.

As discussed in Section 4.1, employing the proposed taxonomy led to an improvement in inter-rater agreement during manual classification.

Moreover, the proposed taxonomy facilitated the identification of more WBMs exhibiting spatial correlation among de- fects compared to WM811K. Accurate classification holds significant importance for root cause diagnosis in wafer fabrication [7–10] since the diagnostic performance relies on accurately classified WBM datasets.

Without the need for model enhancements or additional WBM data collection, the automatic clas- sification model demonstrated better accuracy when using the proposed taxonomy compared to WM811K (Section 4.3).

This extendibility is attributed to the flexibility provided by the spatial dimension-based structure of the proposed taxonomy. This characteristic enables practitioners to continually utilize the proposed taxonomy with some modifications in response to newly emerging patterns, such as those arising from technological advancements. 5.Conclusion The concept of spatial dimension-based defect pattern taxonomy and its development procedure are proposed.

The concept was applied to a NAND flash memory semiconductor manufacturer for two years. Results indicate that the proposed taxonomy possesses the three desirable properties of a general taxonomy (i.e., robustness, comprehensiveness, and extendibility). Also, the domain expertise is integrated through the engineers’ involvement in the proposed taxonomy development procedure. The main contribution of this study is the development of a taxon - omy possessing the three desirable properties through a spatial dimension-based structure. This structure effectively addresses limita - tions found in existing taxonomies, resulting in improved robustness, comprehensiveness, and extendibility. The managerial implications of this study are twofold. Firstly, the classification accuracy of the defect pattern classification system would be improved. The proposed taxonomy possesses robustness and comprehensiveness, allowing for the coherent classification of the WBM dataset. Consequently, this coherently classified dataset contributes to improved accuracy in the defect pattern classification system. Secondly, the proposed taxonomy is considered practical for wafer fabrication diagnostics bec"}

Secondly, the proposed taxonomy is considered practical for wafer fabrication diagnostics because it has integrated domain expertise in its develop - ment procedure. It encompasses a concise set of defect patterns that are meaningful for diagnosing wafer fabrication failures, thus making the classified results more applicable for diagnostics. These managerial implications remain valid for newly-emerged defect patterns due to the extendibility of the proposed taxonomy. Three issues for future research are suggested. The first issue resides in the lack of case studies that validate the general applicability of the concept of spatial dimension-based taxonomy. The desirable properties were demonstrated for one wafer fabrication process in this study. Case studies on other manufacturing circumstances should be conducted in future research to validate the general applicability of the concept and development procedure. The second issue resides in the extension of dimensions. The mixed-type defect patterns occur when several defect patterns appear simultaneously in a wafer. Mixed-type"}

The second issue resides in the extension of dimensions. The mixed-type defect patterns occur when several defect patterns appear simultaneously in a wafer. Mixed-type defect patterns frequently occur due to new technology adoption [5,15]. To classify mixed-type defect patterns, dimensions should be extended. The number [48], overlap [66], and homogeneity [67] of defect patterns may be added to the dimension. The third issue resides in improving the tax- onomy development procedure to be more intelligent. The active learning framework can be adopted to make the engineers’ involvement efficient. For instance, inspection of clustered defects [68] can reduce the number of WBMs to be inspected in Stage 1 of the taxonomy development procedure. Manual identification of the newly-emerged defect patterns can be replaced by the classification uncertainty anal- ysis [53] for prompt extension of the existing taxonomy.

Recently, automated analysis methods using machine learning or deep learning have been studied as alternatives to manual classification by engineers. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the feature extraction performance of defect patterns by transforming the polar coordinate system instead of the existing WBM image input. To reduce the variability of the location representation, defect patterns in the Cartesian coordinate system, where the location of the distributed defect die is not constant, were converted to a polar coordinate system. The CNN classifier, which uses polar coordinate transformed input, achieved a classification accuracy of 91.3%, which is 4.8% better than the existing WBM image-based CNN classifier. Additionally, a tree-structured classifier model that sequentially connects binary classifiers achieved a classification accuracy of 94%.

The method proposed in this paper is also applicable to the defect pattern classification of WBMs consisting of different die sizes than the training data. Finally, the paper proposes an automated pattern classification method that uses individual classifiers to learn defect types and then applies ensemble techniques for multiple defect pattern classification. This method is expected to reduce labor, time, and cost and enable objective labeling instead of relying on subjective judgments of engineers.

Introduction Integrated circuit (IC) chips are manufactured by hundreds of steps of continuous and complex chemical, optical, and mechanical processing on a semiconductor wafer.

This complex semiconductor manufacturing process and miniaturization pro- cess make the chips on the wafer susceptible to various types of defects. To detect the defects during the manufacturing process and analyze their causes, the wafer test steps are essential [ 1]. A typical wafer level test method is electrical die sorting (EDS), which is used to test the electrical characteristics of the chip. EDS tests focus on sorting chips or wafers through AC and DC parameter tests. Additionally, EDS can provide information on fabrication yield and chip functionality. Each die is assigned a bin code or bin code number based on the test results to identify the cause of the defect. Through this process, the defective dies on the wafer are visually represented according to the cause of the defect, forming a wafer image called a wafer bin map (WBM) as shown in Figure 1. Each die is normally represented by a binary logical value of ‘0’ or ‘1’ when a WBM determines only whether a die is failed or not. When the test results require a more detailed di"}

Related Work 2.1. Single-Failure Pattern Classification With the growth of the semiconductor industry, many techniques have been studied to effectively classify defect patterns on wafers.

Several methods have been studied to classify single-defect patterns. Conventional classification methods, such as SVM, were applied in the beginning [ 10]. More recently, researchers have employed deep learning methods, mostly based on convolutional neural network (CNN) models [ 5–7]. CNNs possess translational invariance, which ensures that the absolute position of any image does not affect the classification performance of the model. Well-known models include ResNet and VGG16, and several studies have shown that these CNNs have strong image classification performance [ 11,12]. Nakazawa and Kulkarni [ 5] generated 28,600 synthetic wafer maps containing 22 different defect patterns and used them as training data for a CNN to perform defect pattern classification, resulting in a retrieval error rate of 3.7%.

Shin and Yoo [ 15] applied lightweight models such as EfficientNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and MobileNetV3 to wafer map classification and compared them in terms of classification performance, hardware resource utilization, and execution time. They showed that fast inference is possible without high-performance hardware, making their proposed method applicable to real-world manufacturing. Wang et al.

Nakazawa et al. and Shim et al. balanced the Electronics 2024 ,13, 1360 5 of 32 data by using a small amount of real wafer data and additional synthesized data [ 5,17].

However, there is limited research on the classification of mixed defect patterns compared to single defect patterns. The most common methodology for classifying mixed defect patterns is to separate them into multiple single patterns on a wafer map. Various methods can be used to combine multiple defect patterns into a single pattern, including hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, support vector clustering, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). Among them, Wang et al. [ 25] showed that the single linkage method provides the best separation performance for unlinked mixed patterns. When dealing with mixed defect patterns, it is common for multiple patterns to be stuck together, making it difficult to separate them into a single pattern. Kim et al.

After setting the appro- priate parameters using DBSCAN, a set of defective dies that are successfully clustered is considered as a defect pattern. Dies that do not belong to the cluster are considered as out- liers and removed. If multiple clusters of defect patterns are obtained from a single wafer map, they are classified as mixed patterns. The clusters extracted using this method can be referred to as mixed patterns. This approach proves useful when the algorithm parameters are adjusted based on the distribution of defect dies in each wafer map.

The extracted patterns were recognized as 16 types of failure patterns on the basis of a simple decision tree, and the performance was better than the results of the combination of the existing clustering method and a CNN. Furthermore, X-ray computed tomography has been recently utilized for defect anal- ysis in various engineering fields [ 31,32]. If high-resolution 3D images of semiconductor chips can be acquired through this method, physical defect analysis will be possible.

To address this issue, a data selection process was applied in this paper, and we have taken 26×26WBMs among various sizes of WBMs. Table 1 lists the number of data by defect type for the 26 ×26 WBMs. The data show a high number of ‘none’ pattern defects compared to other types, which is consistent with the overall imbalance in semiconductor production data.

Random Noise Filtering and Data Augmentation Figures 1, 2a,b and 4 show that there are randomly located defect dies on the WBM called random noise, in addition to the defect dies that match the typical trend of the defect pattern. In this paper, the term ‘randomly located defect die’ refers to defective dies that are located independently of the characteristics of the typical defect types. These defect dies act as noisy data in the defect pattern classification process. The patterned defect die populations are mainly influenced by controllable factors in the wafer production process, such as process parameters, equipment defects, and improper operation.

However, the presence of random noise in wafer production is often due to a lack of process environment management or factors that are difficult to control directly. To reduce random noise, gradual improvement of the process environment or replacement of expensive equipment over a long period of time is necessary [ 33]. As a result, there are always defect dies corresponding to noise in the WBM. In this case, the number of noise defects degrades the geometric and spatial characteristics of the defect pattern. Therefore, it is necessary to remove random noise before using wafer defect patterns as training data. It is difficult to determine with certainty whether each die is a ‘randomly located defect die’ or not. However, they are typically distributed uniformly across the wafer, similar to salt noise in an image. In this study, we denoise the center pixel of a 3 ×3 region by converting it to a normal die if there are less than N pixels in the 3 ×3 region that correspond to defective dies. In other words, "}

The structure of the proposed classifier is shown in Figure 9. To implement this model, we first relabel the polar coordinate system data presented in Section 3.2 into two categories: the corresponding defect pattern and other patterns, and generate binary classification models for eight defect patterns (Center, Donut, Edge-Loc, Edge-Ring, Loc, Near-Full, Random, and Scratch). Eight classification results are extracted for WBM images from the output layer by ensembling classifiers for each defect pattern.

However, the labeling of WBMs is subjective and relies on the judgment of semiconductor engineers. In practice, many WBMs are judged as a mixture of two or more defect patterns.

Figure 10 shows a visualization of the classification results in the form of a confusion matrix of Model 1. The model shows a large number of misclassifications between the ‘Edge-Loc’ and ‘Loc’ patterns among the eight defect patterns. The reason for the large misclassification is that the labeling decision may vary depending on subjective judgment compared to other defect patterns.

Defect Pattern Classifier Based on Polar Coordinate System Input Data and Tree Structure To implement the defect pattern classifier based on the polar coordinate system data and tree structure described in Section 3.3, we first created a binary classifier for each defect pattern. The training data were selected based on the experimental results presented in Section 4.1, using Model 4, which showed the best classification performance. In Section 4.2, we did not classify the defect patterns into eight classes. Instead, we created eight binary classifiers, each for a specific pattern. To achieve this, we implemented a model using support vector machine (SVM), which is a representative machine learning algorithm for binary classification. We then compared its performance with the binary classification model based on the CNN. The training data to test data ratio was set to 7:3 for both SVM and CNN models.

Table 11 shows a comparison of the binary classification performance of the two models. As indicated in Table 11, the CNN model outperforms the SVM model on most performance metrics. Regarding the SVM model, similar to the classification results in Section 4.2, the performance is poor for ‘Edge-Loc’, ‘Loc’, ‘Random’, and ‘Scratch’ patterns, which are considered highly randomized defect patterns. This is due to SVM’s binary linear classification model, resulting in low performance for classes with high randomness between patterns. Therefore, we used CNN-based binary classifiers for each node of the tree-structured classifier. Table 11. Comparison of the binary classification performance for 25,519 WBM data.

Table 13 shows the variation in data quantity among each class in the training process of the binary classifier used in the corresponding tree structure and it is estimated to be a factor affecting the performance of the classifier. In summary, if the process of learning the features of the defect pattern class with a small amount of data is heavily influenced by the data trained as ‘Others’ with a relatively large amount of data, it is expected to be affected by the data imbalance problem. This can cause a stronger tendency to classify as ‘Others’ in the binary classification process.

Ensemble Models for Mixed-Fault Pattern Classification To implement the mixed defect pattern classifier using polar coordinate system data and the ensemble structure presented in Section 3.4, we selected the training data of Model 4 since it demonstrated the best classification performance in the experimental results shown in Section 4.1. Then, for each class, we relabeled them into two classes: corresponding pattern and other patterns, and generated binary classification models for each of the eight defect patterns (Center, Donut, Edge-Loc, Edge-Ring, Loc, Near-Full, Random, and Scratch).

The CNN-model-based binary classifiers have the CNN structure depicted in Figure 7 with two output layers. The training data to test data ratio was set to 7:3, with a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 0.01, and 300 epochs. And three-fold cross-validation was conducted. The binary classification models were connected in parallel, and the output from each model for each test WBM was aggregated for a total of eight outputs. In this step, the classification result is determined by the soft-voting ensemble method and we set 0.7 as the threshold value. From the original data of 26 ×26 in size shown in Table 1, we excluded the ‘none’ pattern and used the remaining 877 WBMs as test data. Since these data are the original data before removing the outlier data, it is appropriate to use them as test data for the model because they contain images that are difficult to judge with a specific label or contain mixed defect patterns, as shown in Figure 4.

Discussion The experimental results of six models confirm that the proposed polar coordinate system conversion method and pre-processing method can improve the WBM defect pat- tern classification performance. In examining the confusion matrix of Model 1, which was trained on the WBM image itself, it becomes apparent that the majority of misclassifications were found in the classes associated with ‘Edge-Loc’, ‘Loc’, and ‘Scratch’. These classes present limitations in terms of specifying the location where the defect patterns are dis- tributed. The defect die clusters’ spatial randomness during the WBM image learning process, as described in Section 3.3, led to lower classification accuracy in these classes. Model 3 aimed to solve the problem by using polar coordinate transformed inputs but this approach actually resulted in a decrease in the classification accuracy. The reason for this is that the number of points corresponding to a single defective die is relatively small compared to the polar coordinate space. When the resolution of the location informatio"}

The reason for this is that the number of points corresponding to a single defective die is relatively small compared to the polar coordinate space. When the resolution of the location information expressed in 26 ×26 is converted to polar coordinate space, the features of the defective die are not properly learned. To address this limitation, Model 4 applies a pre-processing process that divides the polar coordinate space into regions of a certain size and measures the number of defective dies included per specified region. This model has the highest classification accuracy among the models compared in this paper. We confirmed that the model is applicable to the defect pattern classification test of WBMs with different die sizes than the WBM used for training. For the tree-structured model (Model 5), which connects binary classifiers sequentially instead of using a single CNN, the classification accuracy is 94%. This is an improvement over Model 4, which classifies eight defect patterns at once. However, in the defect pattern classification test of 25,519 WBMs with different die sizes than the ones used for training, the accuracy is lower than that of Model 4. This is likely d"}

However, in the defect pattern classification test of 25,519 WBMs with different die sizes than the ones used for training, the accuracy is lower than that of Model 4. This is likely due to the model structure’s inability to overcome the data imbalance problem of the binary classifier itself and the variation in the amount and characteristics of the test data depending on the node where the binary classifier is located. Therefore, for the single defect pattern classification problem of WBM, Model 4 is considered to be the most appropriate among the models tested in this paper. Table 15 shows the performance comparison of the model proposed in this paper with the results of several studies that classify WBM defect patterns using the WM-811K dataset. C.-Y. Wang et al.

However, the ultimate aim of WBM defect pattern classification is to provide information that can quickly identify errors in the semiconductor process by identifying the type of defect pattern. Therefore, it is important to not only classify the single-defect patterns but also to identify WBMs labeled as having only one defect but whose defect pattern classification is ambiguous due to the overlap of multiple defects.

To solve this problem, we implemented a model (Model 6) that can classify mixed-defect patterns by ensembling binary classifiers in parallel to classify defect patterns without additional clustering of defect patterns. The model classified about 30 WBMs out of 877 WBMs as containing multiple defects. This number of instances is significant enough to impact classification accuracy by more than a few percentage points. However, since there are no WBMs labeled as having mixed-defect patterns in the dataset, an accurate evaluation is not possible. Therefore, we manually reviewed the WBMs classified as containing multiple-defect patterns. As a result, we found many appropriate classification results, but there were also cases where patterns judged to be single defects were classified as multiple defects. Therefore, additional verification and research are necessary based on the labeling data of mixed-defect patterns. Electronics 2024 ,13, 1360 30 of 32 6.

Conclusions In this paper, we constructed six models, including a comparison model, and evalu- ated their performance based on input data transformation, pre-processing method, and classifier structure. For input data transformation, the defect die information on the WBM is converted to the polar coordinate system to enhance the characteristics of the distribution of defect dies by wafer defect class, rather than using the WBM image as input. The binary- classifier-based tree-structured classifier was used for single-failure pattern classification and the CNN-based ensemble classifier was used for mixed-defect pattern classification. The WM-811K dataset was used to classify failure patterns based on a 26×26-sized WBM. The model trained on a conventional WBM image achieved a classification accuracy of 86.5%. However, the model’s classification accuracy was 91.3% when the polar coordinate system space was divided into specific ranges based on the transformed polar coordinate system data and the number of defective dies belonging to the range was measured. This confirms that polar coordinate system transformed data can more ea"}

This confirms that polar coordinate system transformed data can more easily extract pattern- specific features of defective dies compared to WBM image information, which is generally used for defect pattern classification, thus contributing to improved defect pattern clas- sification performance. Additionally, a tree-structured model was implemented, which sequentially connects binary classifiers for each class trained on polar coordinate system data. This resulted in a classification accuracy of 94%, surpassing the 91.3% accuracy of the model that classifies eight defect classes in one step. However, we discovered that serializing the binary classifiers worsened the existing WM-811K data imbalance problem. Therefore, a single CNN using polar coordinate system transformed input achieved higher accuracy than a tree-structured classifier based on binary classifiers for defect pattern classification of WBMs of all sizes, except for the 26 ×26 WBM used for training.

Finally, to classify mixed-defect patterns, we designed individual classifiers for each failure pattern class by learning polar coordinate data. Then, we used the ensemble technique to classify the mixed defect patterns in WBM images without any additional clustering process. This study aims to identify the cause of defects in semiconductor mass production by analyzing WBMs that contain ambiguity or multiple defects in the labeling results. The focus is not solely on improving pattern recognition accuracy based on labeling but on providing useful information for defect identification. However, more data are needed to make an objective judgment. Therefore, further verification and research are required based on the data accumulated through engineers’ mixed-defect pattern labeling processes. Furthermore, it is expected that the classification performance can be improved by developing an algorithm to select an adaptive threshold (N) value based on the distribution of defect dies in the WBM during random noise removal and studying the CNN architecture optimized for input data expre"}

After fabrication, serial electrical probe tests are conducted for each semiconductor chip on a wafer to investigate whether the chip is defective. The chip is a physical object that exists on a wafer and bin is a variable indicating on which test the chip failed. Suppose that 10 serial electrical probe tests are con- ducted for each chip. The result of each electrical probe test is recorded as binary indicating that the chip is functional or defective. After the serial electrical probe tests, each chip has its own bin value according to its test results. Because there are 10 binary tests, a total of 1024 (210) bins are possible. The probe test results are represented by a wafer bin map (WBM), which is an image showing the bins and locations of chips on a wafer. A chip is a physical object that exists on wafer and bin is a variable indicating on which test the chip failed. In other words, chip itself has no information.

In Fig. 1(b), two spatial patterns of the defects (referred to as defect patterns hereinafter) in the WBM can be identified: 1) green defects are clustered on the upper-left part of the WBM, and 2) red defects are placed vertically, exhibiting a scratch pattern.

Because these are supervised learning methods, training data should be prepared by labeling WBMs. For coherent labeling, defect patterns should be defined in advance. For example, the WM811K taxonomy is a repre - sentative method for defining defect patterns. Defect patterns observed in the WM811K dataset —the largest WBM dataset available to the public (Wu et al., 2015 )—are classified according to the WM811K tax- onomy, as shown in Fig. 2. Extensive studies have been conducted to define various defect patterns. However, the existing defect-pattern taxonomies, including the WM811K taxonomy, have common limitations in that they do not allow clear differentiation among defect patterns. To cope with this difficulty, Choi et al. (2021) proposed a spatial dimension-based taxonomy (SDT) with three spatial dimensions of a defect pattern: shape, size, and location. Levels are defined in each dimension with detailed criteria by reflecting the spatial features of the defect pattern; thus, the SDT can define the defect pat"}

(2021) employed the SDT to develop a CNN model for the defect pattern. A high-quality training dataset was obtained by coherently labeling the detected patterns according to the SDT. Despite the advantages of the SDT, it may not be effective for iden- tifying significant defect patterns, because it does not consider the bins of chips on WBMs, although useful information can be obtained by considering it. First, it is possible to identify a major bin in a WBM. When the defects are marked only with white regardless of their bins, as shown in Fig. 1, wafers may have similar spatial defect patterns, but the major bins constituting the patterns may not be the same.

Accordingly, the assignable causes resulting in the bins may not be the same. Second, it is possible to identify the spatial distribution of each bin in the WBM; thus, new defect patterns can be defined. By tracking wafers with new defect patterns, new assignable causes can be identified. One simple approach for considering the bin in the WBM is to apply a random coloring approach, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In this approach, the color for each bin is randomly determined, and each chip is marked with a random color according to its bin. In such a case, the relationships among the bins cannot be preserved. Recently, Kim et al. (2019) pro- posed Bin2Vec —a neural network-based bin coloring method. Bin2Vec uses Word2Vec to transform the bins into three-dimensional vectors so that the spatial similarity between bins can be measured. By regarding the three-dimensional vectors as RGB codes, chips can be marked with colors according to the RGB codes. This allows similar bins to be rep- resented by similar colors. In the probe test, if two chips are physically close to each other, their test results are likely to be similar. This is because wa"}

This allows similar bins to be rep- resented by similar colors. In the probe test, if two chips are physically close to each other, their test results are likely to be similar. This is because wafer fabrication is a batch process, and nearby chips are likely to be processed under the same manufacturing conditions. The Bin2Vec-based coloring method reflects the nature of the probe test by representing similar bins with similar colors. It makes major bins, whose degree of similarity to the bin of the normal chip is low, more noticeable because most of the chips are normal. This is useful for identifying sig- nificant defect patterns. Because of this advantage, we used Bin2Vec to develop a taxonomy that considers the bins of the defect patterns. The proposed taxonomy was developed by adding a bin dimension to the SDT; i.e., the proposed taxonomy consists of the shape, size, location, and bin dimension.

Other researchers proposed similar taxonomies (Hsieh and Chen, 2004; Hwang and Kuo, 2007; Yuan and Kuo, 2007; Wang, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2012; Nakata et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2021; Liu and Chien, 2013 ).

Although such taxonomies have been widely used, their usefulness is limited by the unclear criteria for differentiation between defect pat- terns. The set of defect patterns is provided without a precise definition of each defect pattern.

According to the three spatial dimensions, the SDT provided a clear definition of the defect patterns. Ten defect patterns were derived using the SDT, as shown in Table 1. Nine patterns were defined (with the exception of noise –infrequent –scattered , which was defined for normal wafers). WBMs were labeled coherently according to the 10 detected patterns, resulting in good classification performance for the 10 defect patterns. The 10 defect patterns were validated through an investigation of the assignable causes by collaborating with the semiconductor manufacturing company.

In addition, new defect patterns can be defined by considering the spatial distribu - tion of bins in the WBM, which is useful for identifying the assignable causes. In this regard, we propose a new four-dimensional taxonomy that extends the SDT by adding the bin dimension. In the proposed taxonomy, Bin2Vec and clustering methods are used to develop the bin dimension. Bin2Vec is reviewed in Section 2.2. 2.2. Bin2Vec The random RGB coloring method is a simple approach for pre- senting bin information in the WBM. WBMs are colorized by assigning randomly selected RGB codes to each bin so that different bin values can be distinguished in the WBM. The main drawback of this method is that the relationships between the bins are not preserved. In practice, some bins are closely related, whereas others are completely unrelated (Choi et al., 2021 ).

Bin2Vec is a neural network-based bin coloring method that assigns an RGB code to each bin so that similar bins have similar RGB codes. This idea was inspired by the domain knowledge of semiconductor practitioners that nearby chips often fail the same test. Bin2Vec trans - forms a one-dimensional scalar bin into a three-dimensional embedding vector by employing the learning mechanism of the Word2Vec embed - ding model. Word2Vec is a widely used neural network-based distrib - uted representation method that represents a word in a fixed dimension (Mikolov et al., 2013a, 2013b ). Compared with traditional one-hot encoding methods, Word2Vec can preserve the semantic relationship between words. When considering words as bins, Bin2Vec can preserve the spatial relationship between the bins. Once the bin is converted into a three-dimensional vector, it can be used not only to assign an RGB code, which can also be considered a three-dimensional vector, but also to compute the similarity between any two bins (Kim et al., 2019 ).

Bin2Vec employs the Skip-Gram structure because it is more effective than CBOW for learning infrequent words. Table 1 Defect patterns of SDT (reprinted from Choi et al. (2021) ).

No bin information exists in the dataset of Choi et al. (2021) . In contrast, the newly provided dataset included probe-test results for every chip on the wafers. The location of each chip on a wafer was denoted by x and y coordinates, and the bin for the chip was included. The wafer size was 27×22, and each chip on the wafer had a bin value ranging from 1 to 57. The chips with a bin value of 54 were normal chips, whereas those with other bin values were defects. Fig. 5 shows the bin distribution of the defects. Each defect corre - sponded to one bin value ranging from 1 to 57 (with the exception of 54).

First, the wafers were screened to balance the number of wa- fers. Because most of the chips were normal, the training data were imbalanced. When such data are used for training the Bin2Vec model, the relationship between bins can be misleading. To investigate this issue, we trained the Bin2Vec model without wafer screening. Fig. 6 shows the RGB codes of the 57 bins obtained from the Bin2Vec model. Bin 54 exhibited an isolated RGB code, and the other bins were relatively closely clustered. When most of the chips were normal, the chips sur- rounding the normal chips were also likely to be normal. Because defective chips rarely exist, the defective chips can be considered as outliers in terms of the normal chip. In contrast, although majority is a normal chip, the chips surrounding the defective chip can be another defective chip. This is because the defective chips often locate nearby as shown in Table 1. This makes the RGB code of the normal chip (i.e., Bin 54) is quite different from those of defective chips. Also, this makes defective "}

A total of 10,174 wafers were manually classified, and 4672 wafers were found to have defect patterns. Among them, we selected 3630 wafers with six large or long defect patterns. Specifically, the six large or long defect patterns were cluster-big-center , cluster-big-edge , cluster-big-others , noise-frequent-scattered , ring-all-edge , and scratch-long-all . We selected wafers with these defect patterns because they were considered to be more critical than the other patterns. For normal wafers (i.e., wafers with a Noise –Infrequent –Scattered pattern in Table 1), we selected 500 wafers from 500 lots (a single wafer from each lot) to accurately represent the chara"}

For normal wafers (i.e., wafers with a Noise –Infrequent –Scattered pattern in Table 1), we selected 500 wafers from 500 lots (a single wafer from each lot) to accurately represent the characteristics of the entire lot, because the wafers in the same lot are likely to be homogeneous in a batch process such as the wafer fabrication process. As a result, we selected 3630 wafers from the six large or long defect patterns and 500 wafers from the normal pattern. Each pattern commonly includes approximately 500–700 wafers; thus, the training data were balanced. Second, pairs of bin vectors were prepared to train the Bin2Vec model. Fig. 3 shows an example of the target chip and its surrounding chips. According to the Skip-Gram structure, the bin of the target chip and the bins of the surrounding chips served as the input and output vectors, respectively. Like the example in Fig. 3, it should be decided which chips to include as the surrounding chips. The surrounding chips can be selected by setting C value.

When C changes, the training dataset changes accordingly. This results in changes in RGB of each bin; thus, the C value should be carefully selected. Basic rule for setting the value of C is considering the degree of similarity in electrical characteristics between the two chips (i.e., target and surrounding chips). The closer the chip is, the more similar the electrical characteristics to the target chip, so it should be selected as the surrounding chip. Also, larger C value generates more pairs of surrounding and target chips. This re- quires more computational burden for training Bin2Vec model. We interviewed the probe test engineer about the similarity in the electrical characteristics of the two chips to determine the C value. As a result, we found that chips within a 5×5 grid might have high simi- larity in the electrical characteristics. For this reason, we set C12. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with respect to C to support the engineer ’s decision. We applied C4, 12, 24. As shown in Fig. 3, C equals to 12 when the grid is 5×5.

Fig. 7 shows examples of WBM colored by Bin2Vec for the three C values. As we expected, RGBs were different according to the C values. Among them, differences in colors of bins were biggest when C12. This big difference in colors is helpful in defining the bin dimension. Based on the process engineer ’s decision and the result of the sensitivity analysis, we set C12. Third, the pairs of bin vectors were deleted. When a chip and its surrounding chips had the same bin value, the pairs of bin vectors generated from these chips had the same input and output vectors. These pairs of bin vectors were deleted because they provided no information regarding the spatial similarity between bins. Additionally, when the surrounding area of a normal chip only consisted of other normal chips or non-wafer parts, the generated vectors were deleted, for the same reason.

We then assigned each of the other bins to the closest centroid among the five centroids. Thus, five clusters were obtained, as shown in Fig. 9. For each cluster, we calculated the average RGB code and represented it as a color, as shown in the right part of Fig. 9.

Step 5: extending SDT by adding bin dimension We converted the probe-test data of the 4130 wafers to WBMs to visually identify the defect patterns. The 4130 wafers were selected in Step 2 to train the Bin2Vec model. Each chip was marked with a color according to its bin, as shown in Fig. 9. For example, a chip with bin 24 was marked yellow. Thus, we obtained 4130 WBMs marked with four colors. Through manual inspection of the 4130 WBMs, we identified two new defect patterns that were not defined in the SDT. Fig. 10(a) shows the WBM marked with white for defects, regardless of their bins. A large cluster of defects is located in the center of the WBM.

Here, we observe that two clusters marked purple are located in the upper and lower areas within the large cluster marked in yellow. The shape of this new defect pattern is similar to that of an “8” or a “snowman. ” Several WBMs exhibited this “8” pattern. Surprisingly, this pattern has not been previously observed, according to interviews of practitioners from the semiconductor manufacturing company. New assignable causes were identified by investigating the fabrication pro- cess, which is expected to affect the purple-colored bins. We found that both the “8” pattern and associated assignable causes resulted from new process development. Similarly, we identified another new defect pattern —a “flipped C” pattern —and associated assignable causes. These findings indicate that the proposed taxonomy can identify valid patterns.

These findings indicate that the proposed taxonomy can identify valid patterns. Before extending the SDT, we modified it by adding two new patterns and excluding insignificant patterns. The sizes of the two new defect patterns were either small or large; thus, we defined them as 8-All-Center and FlippedC-All-Center . The existing SDT consists of 10 defect patterns, as shown in Table 1. To exclude non-critical defect patterns, we comprehensively evaluated each defect pattern by interviewing the practitioners of the semiconductor company that provided the probe- test data. We concluded that four defect patterns with small sizes (i.e., cluster –small –edge, cluster –small –others , noise –infrequent –scattered , and scratch –short –all) were not critical; thus, we excluded them. This exclusion is consistent with that of Step 2. Thus, eight defect patterns were defined. Next, we extended each of the defect patterns using the three colors defined in Step 4.

The proposed taxonomy has three advantages over existing taxon - omies, including the SDT, which do not consider the bins of chips in the WBM. First, a group of major bins of the defect pattern can be identified according to the bin dimension. For example, the first three defect patterns in Table 2 are considered identical in terms of the SDT; how- ever, they are considered different in terms of the proposed taxonomy. The three patterns are likely to result from different assignable causes; thus, new assignable causes can be identified by investigating the wafers having the patterns. Second, new defect patterns can be identified. As mentioned previously, the 8-All-Center and FlippedC-All-Center are new defect patterns defined in the proposed taxonomy. These patterns are likely to result from new assignable causes. Third, non-critical bins can be identified. "}

Because of these advantages, the proposed taxonomy can serve as a basis for various engineering activities, such as detecting and eliminating new assignable causes or analyzing the relationships between bins. In addition, the proposed taxonomy is easy to use in practice. Typi- cally, hundreds of bins exist in probe-test data. The bin dimension of the proposed taxonomy was developed by clustering bins according to spatial similarity, and bins in the same cluster are represented with a single color. This simplifies the taxonomy; thus, inspectors can easily use it with reasonable cognitive effort. Table 3 Number of WBMs before and after augmentations.

The first task was to prepare WBMs for training the CNN model. The WBMs of 11266 wafers were collected and manually classified according to the proposed taxonomy. Each WBM was labeled as one of the defect patterns in Table 2. However, some WBMs exhibited multiple defect patterns or did not exhibit clear defect patterns that could be classified as one of the patterns in Table 1.

According to (Krawczyk, 2016 ), wafer maps showing unclear defect patterns can negatively affect learning. Therefore, we selected 1835 WBMs with a single and clear defect pattern. The second column of Table 3 presents the number of WBMs for each defect pattern. We found that the number of WBMs was imbalanced among the defect patterns and that some of the defect patterns had small numbers of WBMs. Such problems of small and imbalanced data are common in defect-pattern classification and should be solved to ensure high classification performance of the CNN model (Kim et al., 2021 ). We conducted two types of data augmentation. First, we augmented WBMs by replacing colors without modifying their shape, size, or location. The purpose of this augmentation was to resolve the imbalance of colors. For example, the 22nd pattern in Table 3 (i.e., FlippedC-All-Center-Yellow ) had 46 WBMs, whereas the 23rd pattern (i.e., FlippedC-All-Center-Green ) had only two WBMs. To generate the WBMs of the 23rd pattern, we replaced the yellow color of the 46 WBMs of the 22nd pattern with green.

Similarly, we replaced the purple color of the two WBMs of the 24th pattern with green. The number of WBMs of the 23rd defect pattern was increased from 2 to 50 by generating 48 WBMs (462) via simple color replacement. Then, we divided the 50 WBMs as follows: 35 WBMs for training, 7 WBMs for validation, and 8 WBMs for testing, as shown in Table 3 (ratios of approximately 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, which are commonly used). Thus, we augmented the WBMs of all the defect patterns and divided them into three datasets. The “after 1st augmentation ” column of Table 3 presents the number of WBMs for the three datasets. Although the 1st augmentation solved the problem of data imbalance between colors, the number of WBMs was still imbalanced among the shape, size, and location dimensions. To solve this problem, we con- ducted simple transformations, such as rotation, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping, to generate augmented WBMs. We used the Image - DataGenerator library of Keras for augmentation.

(2021) was imbalanced like the case study in this section; thus, they conducted data augmentation before fitting the CNN model. Also, the CNN models of the proposed and Kim et al. (2021) ’s method are same. Thus, we believed that the comparison is fair to investigate the effect of adding color dimension to SDT. The main difference between the pro- posed taxonomy and SDT is that the proposed method considers the color dimension whereas SDT does not. To resolve this issue, we merged three defect patters having same shape-size-location into a single defect pattern. As a result, the 24 defect patterns are merged into 8 defect patterns as shown in Table 5. Average of three classification perfor - mance values are calculated accordingly.

Average of three classification perfor - mance values are calculated accordingly. The left part of Table 5 reports the averages of the classification performance values. Originally, the SDT defined 10 defect patterns; however, six of them are common with the 8 defect patterns of the proposed taxonomy. Thus, classification performance indices for the common 6 defect patterns of the SDT are reported in the right part of Table 5. It should be noted that the CNN model developed from the proposed taxonomy shows better classifica - tion performance compared to the CNN model from the SDT. This result indicates that considering bin information in developing taxonomy and classification model is helpful for achieving high classification performance. 5.Concluding remarks We proposed a taxonomy composed of the shape, size, location, and bin dimension for classifying defect patterns. It extends the existing SDT by adding the bin dimension. The bin dimension was developed by employing the Bin2Vec method, which determines the RGB code for each bin according to the spatial similarity between bins. Three levels of the bin dimension w"}

The bin dimension was developed by employing the Bin2Vec method, which determines the RGB code for each bin according to the spatial similarity between bins. Three levels of the bin dimension were defined by analyzing a large number of WBMs using Bin2Vec and clustering methods. Compared with the existing taxonomies, the proposed taxonomy has the advantage of identifying major bins in WBMs, new defect patterns, and non-critical defect pat- terns. A total of 24 defect patterns were defined in the proposed tax- onomy, and a CNN model for classifying the 24 patterns was developed to validate the taxonomy. A high-quality training dataset was obtained using the proposed taxonomy; thus, the CNN model exhibited satisfac - tory classification performance. In this paper, the proposed method was solely applied to extend the specific taxonomy, SDT proposed by Choi et al. (2021) . However, the proposed method is not tied to this specific taxonomy but is a universal approach that can be applied to any defect-pattern taxonomy.

Any defect-pattern taxonomies be extended by adding the bin dimension through the proposed 5-step procedure. The first four steps determine RGB for each bin and form clusters based on their RGBs. Actually, the first four steps are conducted without SDT. In Step 5, SDT is extended by adding the bin dimension. In this step, SDT can be simply replaced with other taxonomy. Recently, using CNN has been a common practice when classifying the defect patterns. One of important issues of using CNN is preparing a high-quality training dataset to learn CNN classifier. The high-quality training dataset can be obtained when each defect pattern is labeled coherently through well-defined taxonomy. The proposed method could obtain the well-defined taxonomy by adding useful bin information. Major bins of defect patters, new defect patterns, and non-critical defect patterns could be identified thorough the proposed method. These cannot be obtained by solely using the existing methods such as the existing taxonomies, Bin2Vec, Clustering, CNN and so on.

As a direction for future research, more systematic preprocessing and clustering are needed. In Step 2, the probe-test dataset was preprocessed through wafer screening and the preparation of bin vectors for training the Bin2Vec model. In Step 2, we selected WBMs with large or long defect patterns. For normal wafers, we selected a single wafer for each lot to represent the characteristics of the entire wafer fairly. In addition, we set C12 to generate pairs of bin vectors. In Step 4, we selected the top five bins and used them as centroids for clustering bins. We collaborated with practitioners of a semiconductor company; thus, all these decisions were based on the empirical knowledge of semi- conductor process engineers. We believe that these decisions were suitable for our probe-test data; however, they may not be suitable for other probe-test data. In this regard, the development of a more sys- tematic approach or guidelines for making optimal decisions for pre- processing and clustering is imperative.

On the other hand, the proposed method uses a neural net only to train Bin2Vec model to assign RGB code for each Bin. Once every Bin has its own RGB code, bins having similar RGB codes are clustered. This clustering is conducted on empirical judgment, but it also can be con- ducted with a neural net model. In order to train the neural net model for clustering, evaluation metrics such as Silhouette coefficient can be employed. Then, optimal clusters can be formed by maximizing the evaluation metric. This might reduce the amount of empirical judgment in the clustering analysis.

This allows the manufacturer to sell non optimal devices at lower rates, so adapting to customer’s quality-price requirements. The binning procedure can be carried out by measuring every single circuit performances, but this approach is costly and time consuming. On the contrary, if alternate measurements are used to characterize the bins, the procedure is considerably enhanced. In such a case, the speciﬁcation bin boundaries become arbitrary shape regions due to the highly non linear mappings between the speciﬁcations space and the alternate measurements space.

The binning strategy proposed in this work functions with the same efﬁciency regardless of these shapes. The digital encoding of the bins in the alternate measurements space using octrees is the key idea of the proposal. The strategy has two phases, the training phase and the binning phase. In the training phase, the speciﬁcation bins are encoded using octrees. This ﬁrst phase requires sufﬁcient samples of each class to generate the octree under realistic variations, but it only needs to be performed once. The binning phase corresponds to the actual production binning of the fabricated ICs. This is achieved by evaluating the alternate measurements in the previously generated octree. The binning phase is fast due to the inherent sparsity of the octree data structure. In order to illustrate the proposal, the method has been applied to a band-pass Butterworth ﬁlter considering three speciﬁcation bins as a proof of concept.

This allows the manufacturer to classify devices according to a quality criterion depending on how close the circuit is to nominal speciﬁcations [6]. Binning of mixed-signal circuits can be achieved by sim- ply measuring the speciﬁcations as in classic speciﬁcation based testing or by performing alternate measurements that correlate to actual speciﬁcations [12], [13]. Alternate testing techniques require a mapping between the speciﬁcation space and the measurements space in order to allow the test decision to be performed. Artiﬁcial intelligence [14] and regression techniques [13], [15], [16] have been used with successful results to this purpose, as well as using octrees to represent the pass/fail regions [17], [18].

S PECIFICATION BASED BINNING OF MIXED -SIGNAL CIRCUITS The procedure of binning analog and mixed-signal circuits after volume production can be formalized as the classiﬁcation of any candidate circuit into a cluster, according to certain cir- cuit performances, among several possible disjoint bins. Such clustering is performed according to parameters of different nature. The most common space for binning mixed-signal circuits is the speciﬁcations space in which circuit performances are directly measured and binned accordingly.

Process variations may cause some circuits to violate or not fulﬁll the set of functional speciﬁcations related to certain bins. The effect of the uncertainties in the manufacturing process are modeled in this work by the statistical distributions offered by tech- nology’s process design kit in the components space. Direct measurement of circuit speciﬁcations is difﬁcult and time consuming [10]. To overcome these drawbacks, the use of alternate measurements is widely adopted as an indirect and effective solution to test analog and mixed-signal ICs [13].

The proposed production binning methodology is performed in two phases, namely, training and binning phases. First, the training phase encodes the speciﬁcation bins in the measure- ments space using octrees relying on circuit samples obtained by simulation, model evaluation or actual production data. After the training phase, the production binning is achieved by evaluating the alternate measurements of a candidate circuit in the previously trained octree data structure. A. Training Phase In order to encode the bins in the measurements space, a considerable amount of representative data need to be generated.

Moreover, if P(M)denotes the joint probability density distribution in the alternate measurements sample space \u001aRn, the average number of comparisons to bin a circuit using the octree data structure is, fNc=nZ h(M)P(M)dM nhmax (2) Despite of the fact that the number of nodes of a sparse 2n-tree grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the measurements space, is because of such inherent sparsity [17] that the average number of required comparisons is far below the theoretical upper bound nhmax.

Certain circuits may be incorrectly binned due to insufﬁcient octree resolution or noise in the measurements. Similarly to test escapes and test yield loss, a new metric to measure the quality of the binning procedure needs to be deﬁned. Here forth, these circuits will be referred as bin escapes. In order to quantify this metric, let pdenote the number of bins and let us deﬁne a p\u0002pmatrixE= (eij) referred from now on as the bin escapes matrix.

Assume a voltage range Vrange and a maximum uncertainty level in the measure of Vnoise, what gives the dynamic range of the measurement, DNR =Vrange=Vnoise.

If octree computation is stopped at level hmax, even when circuit data is available to continue tessellating the space beyond level hmax, the impact of noise can be quantiﬁed as the ratio of the decision pending cells hypervolume and the root node hypervolume. Of course, bin escapes will also reﬂect the noise impact since the values located above and below the diagonal of bin escapes matrix will increase. In the subsequently presented case study the impact of noise in the binning efﬁciency is also explored. IV. C ASE STUDY : 4THORDER BAND -PASSBUTTERWORTH FILTER A.

The former issue has already been studied and simulation results have been reported. It basically depends on the required resolution which is also related with the number of samples used in the training phase. The latter issue, noise, is also of crucial importance thus resolution strictly depends on the DNR in a real world application.

Binning results for different noise levels added to the alternate measurements and different sizes of the training set are reported in Fig. 14. Global bin escapes is considerably affected when noise levels are increased, clearly showing a direct relationship between noise and GBE. Training set size also plays a noticeable role with respect to bin escapes. For the presented case study, if the training set consists of 103circuits, the resulting octree represents the alternate measurements space poorly what translates in high GBE.

Comparison with Support Vector Machines Classiﬁers In order to compare the proposed method for binning mixed- signal ICs with state of the art tools and techniques, a support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer has been trained using exactly the same set of circuits used for octrees which is depicted in Fig. 2. The training procedure has been carried out using MATLAB and the sequential minimal optimization training method. The kernel used in the procedure is a radial basis function (RBF), which is a standard choice in the ﬁeld [36]– [38].

The genera- tion of the octree in the training phase may be computationally intensive but it only needs to be performed once. Its size, i.e. the number of tree nodes, grows exponentially with the number of alternate measurements used (n). Our experiments show acceptable tree sizes for low dimensionalities (n = 2;3). The binning phase performs circuit binning according to the octree generated in the previous phase taking advantage of the inherently sparse octree data structures. In order to show the viability of the proposal, a But- terworth ﬁlter has been designed in an industrial 65 nm CMOS technology and binned using octrees.

After wafer fabrication, circuit probe(CP) testing is performed on each die on the wafer. Then, the wafers are died up, and the good dies arepackaged into chips and shipped to the customer after ﬁnal testing (FT). The critical factors maintaining competitive advantages for semiconductor wafer fabs includelowering die costs via lean production and increas-ing yield via quick response to yield excursions(Leachman and Hodges, 1996 ;Peng and Chien, 2003).

Four yield deﬁnitions are used in semi- conductor manufacturing: CP test yield (CP yield, YCP), fabrication line yield ( YL), assembly yield (YAS) and ﬁnal test yield ( YFT). Among them, the CP yield is the most critical ( Cunningham et al., 1995). CP yield improvement is divided into two major categories: (1) based line yield improvement,and (2) low yield trouble shooting. The based lineyield improvement is based on tuning the processrecipes to improve device performance and reduce defects, while low yield trouble shooting involves monitoring and diagnosing the failures caused byabnormal events such as mis-operation, trouble tooland contamination. Wafer bin map (WBM) is theresult of CP inspection of dies on the wafer at theend of fabrication. WBM patterns can provideinformation to monitor the process and product.

During the manufacturing process, data are collected for various purposes. In particular, Wafer In Process (WIP) data refers to the data collectedwhile processing wafers; metrology data refers to thedata collected from in-line inspections; electrical test(E-test) data refers to data collected to measuredevice performance in chips, and the CP test datarecords each chip’ functional test result after waferfabrication. Since modern fabs are equipped with the computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) system, data collection is no longer a major issue. Further-more, an engineering data analysis (EDA) systemthat is an off-line analysis-oriented system with data warehouse is generally developed to support data analysis activities ( Peng and Chien, 2003 ;Chien et al., 2007 ).

A remaining issue is to sieve out relevant data from a massive pool to derived useful informa-tion that can assist engineers in timely troubleshooting and yield enhancement. WBMs are multi-dimensional and have complex structures, can provide essential information forengineers to identify problems in the manufacturing process. Fig. 1 shows a typical WBM where the different symbols denote chips failing in differentfunctional tests. To assist visualization and analysis,WBM is usually transformed into a binary map thatrepresents it using binary code or two differentcolors. This study uses yellow squares or ‘‘1’’ todenote defective chips, and red squares or ‘‘0’’ todenote functional chips. The failure patterns of WBM can be classiﬁed into three major categories ( Taam and Hamada, 1993;Stapper, 2000 ): (1) Random defect: No spatial clustering or pattern exists, and the defective chips are randomlydistributed in the two-dimensional map.

Problem formulation This study addresses the problem of ﬁnding patterns from WBMs to monitor semiconductor manufacturing process and provide pattern infor- mation for trouble shooting. Engineers have tointegrate and analyze large amounts of data duringanalysis. Data mining can efﬁciently ﬁnd hidden yetpotentially valuable information in terms of speciﬁcpatterns from massive data ( Keki et al., 1993 ; Kusiak, 2000 ;Peng et al., 2004 ).

By reviewing WBMpatterns, experienced engineers can quickly clarifythe root causes and identify the assignable causes.Most existing studies focus on diagnosing systema-tic defects or patterns in wafer maps ( Mallory et al., 1983;Hansen and Nair, 1995 ;Kaempf, 1995 ; Friedman et al., 1997 ), but give no information about pattern types. The lack of adequate tools has also led engineers to only use data relating to simple measures such asoverall yield to track process problems. Experiencedengineers review the WBM to possibly identifyspatial patterns with only visual analysis based onprinted maps.

ART for map clustering The ART ( Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988 ; Freeman and Skapura, 1991 ) has been applied in many areas including pattern recognition andspatial analysis. ART derives fundamentally fromthe adaptive resonant feedback between two layersof neurons. To manage the variety input, ART hasthe following characteristics: (1) balance on stabilityand plasticity, (2) match and reset, and (3) balance on search and direct access. ART solves the stability–plasticity dilemma, which is caused bylearning new data leading to unstable conditionsand loss of data. Several algorithms are derivedfrom the original ART, including ART1 ( Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988 ), ART2 ( Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987 ), ART3 ( Carpenter and Grossberg, 1990), ARTMAP ( Carpenter et al., 1991 ), and Fuzzy ART ( Carpenter et al., 1991 ). This study employs the ART1 algorithm for WBM clustering, since the input data form a binary map. 3.3.

Decision tree Decision tree can be used to extract models to describe important data classes or to predict futuredata trends. A decision tree is a ﬂow-chart-like treestructure where the root at the top and the leaves atthe bottom. Through serial tests on the attributes of the root node containing the entire dataset, the branches representing the outcomes of the tests andthe leaves indicating the classes are thus con- structed. Each path from the root node to a leaf can be interpreted as a rule. Decision tree construction can be separated to three basic elements: ﬁrst, growing the tree; second,pruning the tree; third, extracting rules from thetree. Several algorithms have been developed toconstruct decision tree model. Chi-squared auto-matic interaction detection (CHAID) is a non-binary decision tree that determines the best multi- way partitions of the data on the basis of signiﬁcance tests ( Kass, 1980 ).

The splitting criterion of C4.5 algorithm is gain ratio that expresses the proportionon information generated by a split. The error-based pruning is used to C4.5 for pruning. Lim et al. (2000) compared the prediction accuracy, complex- ity and training time of 33 classiﬁcation algorithms, and indicated that decision tree provides good accuracy and data interpretation. 4.

(1) Data integration: Engineers usually use a speciﬁc bin or combined multi-bins to query WBM data.Two options are available for integrating theWBM data: Analysis by wafer where each maprepresents a wafer, the other is analysis by lot where the map is generated from all wafers within the lot.

(2) Data cleaning: Missing data often arise in the WBM because the probe might not workcorrectly in some chips during the CP test. This study deletes missing data. Therefore, if aposition of has no test data in one map, thenthe data in this position in other maps are not included in the calculation. (3) Data transformation: The data are transformed into several formats for different purposes. Theproposed framework deﬁnes two formats to betransformed: (a) Binary map: Based on the selected bin, BIN i, the ‘‘binary’’ map is created using 1 to denotethe defective chips, and 0 to denote passing chips.

The index map is deﬁned by coding theposition of each chip in the map with asequence sorted from left to right and top tobottom. Then, each map can be convertedinto a vector in terms of this sequence. Fig. 6 illustrates this transformation process. Thebinary vector is applied to generate the ART1 network. 4.2. Spatial randomness testing Each map is tested for spatial randomness testing and classiﬁed into three types: ‘‘CheckerboardDefect’’, ‘‘Clustered Defect’’ and ‘‘Random De-fect’’. The ‘‘Checkerboard Defect’’ (or ‘‘RepeatingDefect’’) group can be further analyzed by beingdirectly correlated with the lithographic processdata. The ‘‘Clustered Defect’’ maps are clustered using ART1. The ‘‘Random Defect’’ maps are further classiﬁed by the WBM fail rate thatrepresents the degree of trouble in manufacturing.‘‘Random Defect’’ maps are classiﬁed into threesub-groups: ‘‘Minor Fail’’, ‘‘Moderate Fail’’ and‘‘Serious Fail’’.

The maps in the ‘‘ModerateFail’’ group are also clustered by ART1 to ensurethat no information has been lost in pattern extraction, since the spatial randomness testing only tests the spatial independence between ‘‘Good’’and ‘‘Bad’’ chips, not the pattern itself. Addition-ally, the deﬁnition of ‘neighborhood’ affects the testresults.4.3. Enhance the signal and remove the noise To obtain good clustering results, we developed a data preparation procedure to enhance the signaland remove the noise (ESRN) as follows: First, the King–Move neighborhood is applied to deﬁne the weighs of the adjacent chips. Thepositions on the four nearest neighbors (left, right,top and down) are weighted 1. The corner positionsare weighted 0.5. Second, two rules are applied to each chip in the map.

A numerical example To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case of 25 maps was generated fromseven groups with special patterns plus randomdefects (see Fig. 9 for some of the patterns). Each map contained 63 chips and the fail rate varied from 0% to 100%. (1) Spatial Randomness Testing: Table 2 sum- marizes the spatial randomness results. Threemaps were placed in the ‘‘Clustered Defect’’group with the criterion of p-valueo0.00005 (maps 8, 13 and 16). Three maps with negative log odd ratio and p-valueo0.05 were classiﬁed as the ‘‘Checkerboard Defect’’ (maps 2, 7 and18). Others were classiﬁed as ‘‘Random Defect’’,and were further classiﬁed into three sub-groupsby the fail rate.

Empirical study For validation, an empirical study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frame-work over conventional methods in a wafer fab. Thestudy used a product with high yield variation in CP testing over a period of 2 months. A total of 138 lots completed the CP test during this period.5.1.

The results revealsome speciﬁc patterns deﬁned in Fig. 2 , such as the half-moon (P2), center (P8) and ring patterns (P11). However, some maps had apparent clusteringpatterns and were thus placed in the ‘‘RandomDefect’’ group with no special patterns, which wasdue to the vigilance threshold setting in the ART1network.

An empiri-cal study showed that the proposed framework caneffectively improve the efﬁciency of WBM cluster-ing, save WBM clustering time consistently andprovide the essential information for root causesanalysis. However, the proposed framework that employed ART1 as the clustering method can handle onlybinary map. Other clustering methods such as ART2 can be applied in the framework forclustering the data with continuous type in thefuture study. We found that the parameter settingsin ESRN and ART1 are sensitive to our framework. For example, the number of clusters extracted in the input maps by ART1 is sensitive to the vigilanceparameter. Thus, further studies are needed to ﬁne-tune the parameters in various contexts to increasethe effectiveness of WBM clustering. In addition,some systematic patterns such as ring pattern aredifﬁcult to detect them by neither spatial random-ness testing nor ART.

Related Work A WBM is a two-dimensional failure pattern. Based onvarious defects types, random, systematic, and mixed fail-ure patterns are primary types of WBMs generated duringsemiconductor fabrication [ 19,20]. Random failure patterns are typically caused by random particles or noises in themanufacturing environment. In practice, completely elimi-nating these random defects is difficult. Systematic failurepatterns show the spatial correlation across wafers such asrings,crescentmoon,edge,andcircles.

This makes performance binni ng of multi- core processors a non-trivial task. In this paper, we study m ulti-core binning metrics and strategies to evaluate them efﬁciently . We also show that variation model aware binning can signiﬁcantly reduce the binning overhead with a negligible loss in binning quality. I. INTRODUCTION Performance (or speed) binning refers to test procedures to ﬁnd out the maximum operating frequency of a processor. It is com mon practice to speed bin processors for graded pricing.

For multi-core processors, how ever, the appropriate binning metrics are much less clear. •Because of large number of cores per die and increasing proce ss variations [5][1], it is unlikely that the maximum operatin g frequencies of all cores would be similar. Therefore, if bin ning is done according to lowest common operating frequency of all cores (one obvious extension to the uniprocessor binnin g metric), it would be highly pessimistic. •Time overhead for binning is an important metric and a choice needs to be made between the correlation to performance and binning overhead for multi-core processors. In this paper, we discuss two binning metrics and quantify th eir correlation with absolute performance and time overhead. W e also show that the process variation model itself can be used to co me up with binning strategies that take much less time for binning without signiﬁcantly sacriﬁcing correlation to performance.

The min-max metr ic is computed with equation 2, where nrepresents the number of frequency bins, mrepresents the number of processor cores, and fijis a successful test frequency or 0 if core j fails the ithtest. minmax =min[max[fij|n i=1|m j=1 (2) The second binning metric that we look at is Σfwhich ranks processors based on maximum attainable throughput [6] (eve ry core operating at its maximum frequency). Σf=m ∑ j=1max[fij|n i=1 (3) In terms of correlation of the metric with the throughput of the chip, min-max is a conservative metric and, therefore, s hould demonstrate good correlation only for workloads with regul ar par- titioning in which the load is distributed evenly between al l cores."}

For other workloads that have inherent heterogeneity or tha t are multiprogrammed, Σfshould demonstrate good correlation. To compare the two metrics, consider the asymptotic case of v ery largenandmand completely random core-to-core variation (i.e., A, B, C, D,E, F, M all zero in equation 1). In this simpliﬁed cas e, Σfconverges to m×meanfrequency whileminmaxconverges to (E(Mini=1...∞fi) =0, i.e., we expect the minmax to be a progres- sively worse metric as number of cores in a die increases or th e variation increases. B. Binning Overhead To calculate binning overhead for min-max for nfrequency bins andmcores, we use binary search3to ﬁnd out fmaxfor every core. However, the search range will reduce progressively. The worst case arises when fmaxfor every core is 1 binsize less than the previously found fmaxfor the last core. In this case, the worst-case tests that need to be performed can be computed as (log(n!)+m−n) (assuming m≥n). The best case binning overhead for min-max would be "}

This stems from t he speciﬁc case of using binary search in conjunction with minmax metric. Th e constraint can be easily avoided by adding one more test per core(i.e., t esting it at the minmax frequency coreidepends on minmax frequency seen for the ﬁrst i−1 cores. Assuming nto be large enough for us to approximate (testable) frequency distribution as continuous, the average test tim e can be derived as T=E(Σi=1...mlog(min(x1...xi)) =E(Σi=1...mlog(i×f(x)×(1−F(x))i−1) wheref(x)andF(x)are PDF and CDF of the core frequency distribution respectively.

The average case binning overhead is m×(logn−1).4 IV. USINGVARIATION MODEL TO REDUCEBINNINGOVERHEAD In this section, we argue that the overhead of binning can be considerably reduced by making the binning strategies vari ation model-aware. fmaxof acorecanbestronglypredicted(i.e.meanwith standard deviation around it) based on the process variatio n model. Therefore, process variation model can give a smaller frequ ency range within which the search should be done. A. Curve Fitting The curve-ﬁtting strategy involves approximating the expe cted frequency (in GHz) as well as the standard deviation ( =/radicalbig (σ2 M+ σ2 R)) of a core given its location within a die and die location wit hin the wafer using the variation model (equation 1).

Therefore , we can identify center (= mean) as well as corners (= +/- kσ) of the search range. If the core falls out of this range (decided by k), we assume lowest frequency bin for the core. This reduces both the aver age and worst-case test time for the core. B. Clustering Another strategy for reducing the binning overhead can be cl uster- ingthe cores ina chipmultiprocessor andthen usingmin-max within the cluster (low binning overhead advantage) while using Σfamong the clusters (high correlation to maximum throughput advan tage). To further reduce the overhead of binning, a process like curve ﬁtting can be applied where the process variation model is used to id entify the search range for fmaxof a core. In order to improve the performance correlation within the c luster (especially when across-wafer variations are high), clust ers can also be chosen intelligently to minimize frequency variation (a nd hence loss of correlation) within a cluster.

To this end, the clust er size can be set to be inversely proportional to the spread of frequenc y mean (calculated from the bowl-shape in equation 1) within the cl uster. In general, the dies close to the center of the bowl (typically c lose to the center of wafer) will see clusters of large sizes, while c lusters are smaller for the dies closer to the edge of the wafer. We do not evaluate variable clustering in this paper due to the rel atively low across-wafer variations that our current process varia tion models suggest. 4Note that this expression and the expressions for minmax ign ore the bias introduced in binary search by the probability distributio n of the frequencies themselves.TABLE I Benchmarks used Program Description ammp Computational Chemistry (SPEC) crafty Game Playing:Chess (SPEC) eon Computer Visualization (SPEC) mcf Combinatorial Optimization (SPEC) twolf Place and Route Simulator (SPEC) mgrid Multi-grid Solver: 3D Potential Field (SPEC) mesa 3-D Graphics Library (SPEC) groff Typesetting package (IBS) de"}

Multi-core binning metrics and testing strategies should b e carefully chosen to strike a good balance between goodness of the metri c and time required to evaluate it. Clustering may be constrained by design decisions (e.g., multiple cores sharing the same clocking) as well as by tester power (in this work we have assumed that only one cor e can be tested at a time): topics we intend to further pursue.

ICs are fabricated first as indi- vidual di e on silicon wafers in wafer fabrication facilities. Next, once the die are electrically tested for functionality, the sil i- con wafers are sawed into individual circuits for subsequent assembly or packaging and final testing. A primary component of the wa fer assembly and final testing phases is the idea of binning . During final test, completed ICs may be evaluated in terms of assessing their processing speed (i.e., 3.0 GHz) and/or voltage requirements (i.e., 1.45 volts). After each IC’s fu nc- tionality is assessed and recorded, it is placed ( sorted) by the manufacturer (i.e., the supply side) based on capability testing results in a “bin” corresponding to different product qualities (Uzsoy et al. , 1992) . Consider the following binning scenario: b in 1 coul d be reserved for the “highest functionality” components; bin 2 could contain components with “medium"}

Consider the following binning scenario: b in 1 coul d be reserved for the “highest functionality” components; bin 2 could contain components with “medium functionality ;” bin 3, in turn, could hold the “ low functionality” components. In practice, devices are place d into bins when they fall into a certain functionality range . For example, one bin may contain d e- vices that ha ve a power rating of 89 Watts, a speed of 3.1 GHz, and a voltage level between 1.425 volts and 1.45 volts . Further, it is important to note that product binning is not deterministic, as wafer fab production variability (which is inevitable) leads to variable end product capabilities/functionality. External customers (i.e., the demand side) may place orders with a semiconductor manufacturer for various quantities of products having a wid e range of capabilities —these product capabilities typically map to specific bin designations (i.e., su p- plier bin designations often relate to customer ordering patterns/demands) .

As customer demands occur on a weekly basis , frequent high functionality product substitution for lower functionality product demand can result in significant lost profits.

Hsu and Bassok (1999) present a downgrading substitution model with random demand and random yield that is quite similar to our motivating case of using devices placed in higher functionality bins for lower functionality demand satisfaction. Bitran and Gilbert (1994) study the idea of co -producing different products in batches within the semiconductor manufacturing industry.

Further, we defined the set B to contain bins 1 through 9 and initially examine a two - period time horizon (i.e, T = {1, 2}). Table 1 contains an example matrix for parameter 𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 describing the distribution for each device d into bin b resulting from th e final test stage of semiconductor manufacturing. The values were obtained from our partnering semiconductor manufacturer. This distribution is expressed as the fraction of devices tested that are mapped/placed into each bin.

For example, consider the bin mappings for devices D and G in Table 1. Between these two device types, all bins can be covered . However, the cost of making each de vice type comes into play when a sem i- conductor manufacturer is deciding on which device to produce in order to meet customer demand. For example, if it is more expensive to produce device type G, a semiconductor manufacturer may elect to produce device H products in order to satisfy inventory requirements for bin 7. Next, Table 2 displays example production cost data for each device type. Even though device types D and G can be used solely to produce inventories for all bin types (see Table 1), they are also the most costly to produce, according to Table 2. This tradeoff is especially evident when one considers the inventory holding costs incurred when extra devices are not sold to customers in response to OPN orders.

Unfortunately, our initial solution was determined to be infeasible, which at first we thought was the result of infeas i- ble/uncovered bin mappings. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the integer restrictions on our model’s prim a- ry decision v ariables were the reason for this infeasibility.

Introduction Semiconductor electronics are an essential element in today’s digitized world. This has become common knowledge in 2022 since the U.S. and European governments have released billions of dollars in subsidies to strengthen and foster the semiconductor ecosystem in the U.S. [1] and European [2] chips acts.

ICs are small semiconductor devices that are fundamental components in nearly everything in life and the economy. A subgroup of ICs are microcontrollers (MCUs). An MCU is an IC that combines different systems on one chip; also, the term system-on-chip (SoC) is used. An MCU combines the processor, memory, input/output (I/O) peripherals, and communication interfaces on a single chip. The ﬁeld of applications is enormous. It ranges from tiny household and commercial applications to high-reliable technologies, like space applications and automotive technology. Depending on the application, MCUs must meet different quality, power consumption, performance, and cost requirements. MCUs used in the automotive industry have special needs regarding quality [3] and reliability [4]. This work focuses on MCUs for automotive applications; however, the method can be used for every MCU. 1.1. Motivation and Problem Statement More than 100 of these MCUs are incorporated in modern vehicles [4] and are used in safety-critical steering and braking systems as well as in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

The MCUs must work under extreme temperature conditions from \u000040\u000eCup to 150\u000eC. They are exposed to vibrations and harsh conditions. Moreover, the automotive MCU must ensure to work for up to 15years [5]. A not correctly working MCU can cause tremendous damage and risk human lives. Therefore, much effort is invested in testing and validating automotive MCUs to satisfy quality requirements. The MCU test is essential for ﬁnding defects provoked by the manufacturing process, ensuring proper functionality, and meeting the required speciﬁcations. The major challenge in testing automotive MCUs is to achieve zero-defect quality [6]. This means only MCUs, which are error-free, will be delivered to the customer. However, zero- defect quality is not easy to achieve for large and complex automotive MCUs. Therefore, 1 1.

There are many test stages along the manufacturing process, and modern MCUs have an extensive DFT infrastructure on board to support and enable the various tests. An essential test of the MCUs test procedure is performance screening. The performance of an MCU is the maximum achievable clock frequency at which the device can execute all use cases under worst-case conditions, denoted as FMAX . Performance screening describes the test in which FMAX is determined. Therefore, each device shipped to the customer must pass the performance screening by achieving the performance speciﬁed in the data sheet. The timing of the design in the MCU determines the FMAX . Since the technology node in MCU is shrinking, the timing variability becomes more sensitive to manufacturing, environment, and aging. This timing variability is called PVTA (process, voltage, temperature, aging) variation. The aging component is neglected in this work since it is an elaborate topic that is out of scope. Thus, Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) variability is addressed in this work. The timing of the MCU and FMAX should be satisﬁed regardless "}

Thus, Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) variability is addressed in this work. The timing of the MCU and FMAX should be satisﬁed regardless of the PVT variability. This makes the performance screening even more challenging since the FMAX should be guaranteed under worst-case conditions. Figure 1.1 provides a simpliﬁed illustration of the performance in MCU manufacturing. The performance of manufactured MCUs can be approximated as Gaussian distribution colored in blue [7]. Thus, many of the devices are well centered around the mean. However, there are also devices with lower FMAX , the so-called slow tail on the left side of the distribution, and devices with higher FMAX on the right side, called the fast tail of the distribution. The reason for this distribution lies in the semiconductor manufacturing process itself. The aim is for many components within this Gaussian distribution to fulﬁll the requirement FMAX , which in turn depends on the design border. This design border is the value that is required as a design speciﬁcation. The exact position of the design border depends on many technical as well as ﬁnancial factors."}

This design border is the value that is required as a design speciﬁcation. The exact position of the design border depends on many technical as well as ﬁnancial factors. The brute force approach would shift the design border (red) far to the left sides of the distribution - which means all MCUs are indeed fast. Unfortunately, that does not work since this would result in an MCU design that is not competitive due to area, design effort, and economic reasons. The design border in realistic scenarios is much closer to the distribution and can even cut into this distribution. The performance screening targets testing the performance near the design border. However, the performance cannot be measured directly, and the entire multidimensional PVT space must be considered. In recent years, various methods for determining performance have been proposed. The methods range from structural tests to system-level-tests and indirect monitoring structures [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Due to the fact that a hundred 2 1.

What remains is an inaccuracy that must be priced into the performance screening. In order to safeguard the inaccuracy of the screening, a so-called Guardband (colored orange in Figure 1.1) is used. This margin is added to the performance screening to meet the high-quality requirements - better performance screening methods result in higher screening accuracy, and thus less Guardband is required. In order to determine the performance for the performance screening, indirect monitors are often used. Such indirect monitor structures are ring oscillators (ROs). The oscillation frequency of such ROs is measured, and this measured frequency correlates with FMAX . However, the RO structures usually have a signiﬁcant area overhead, but in turn, have a high resolution and are easy and fast to measure [17].

Furthermore, the quality and accuracy of performance screening depend signiﬁcantly on the design of such RO structures [18, 19, 20]. The functional path ROs [21] are a subtype of ROs that promise advantages in terms of area and accuracy since they use functional paths which are already on the design. However, the functional path ROs need further research on how to implement and control, which paths to select, and how to establish the functional path RO for performance screening on silicon in a large automotive MCU. This work is an important contribution to these endeavors. 1.2. Related Work Determining the performance of modern SoCs is challenging due to their complexity - especially for large MCUs. Three signiﬁcant approaches in FMAX testing are widely used and visualized in Figure 1.2. One way to test performance is to use structural at-speed test patterns, such as Transition Delay Fault [22] patterns or Path Delay Fault [23] patterns [8, 9]. However, such at-speed 3 1.

Performance testing requires an accurate determination of the numerical performance value. A straightforward approach is determining the MCU’s performance with a Functional Test on the automatic test equipment (ATE) [10]. Small critical code blocks as part of the ATE test program are executed, and the clock frequency is increased until the point of failure [11]. However, ATE systems usually have limited power integrity, making the exact performance prediction inaccurate [24]. As a result, System-Level Test (SLT) is gaining increasing attention [12, 13]. In contrast to the functional test on the ATE, the SLT is performed on an application- like board with software close to the device’s ﬁnal application. However, several thousand applications are conceivable. Therefore, all possible applications must be tested under different voltage and temperature conditions to determine the maxim"}

However, several thousand applications are conceivable. Therefore, all possible applications must be tested under different voltage and temperature conditions to determine the maximum performance of every device [24]- which is not an option due to the limited test budget. Thus, SLT is expensive in terms of test time and handling [25]. The third approach is to use indirect monitoring structures. There are many types of such indirect methods. However, they all used indirect metrics that allowed them to conclude performance [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 21]. Razor FF [26, 27] and In-situ slack monitors [28] are some types of indirect monitoring structures. Razor FFs are additional FFs that observe speciﬁc paths on the design and check if the timing is met. Also, in-situ slack monitors observe the remaining slack of a speciﬁc path and give an alarm if the slack margin disappears. Both approaches can be used for performance determination in small circuits where some known paths are timing critical. However, for large MCUs in state-of-the-art CMOS technology, the timing of a design gets more complex [32], and it is challenging to deﬁne discrete time-critical paths. It may b"}

However, for large MCUs in state-of-the-art CMOS technology, the timing of a design gets more complex [32], and it is challenging to deﬁne discrete time-critical paths. It may be that paths, which seem non-critical in the pre-silicon phase may become critical in the post-silicon phase due to process variations in manufacturing [33]. The degradation mechanism also 4 1. Introduction affects the performance [34]. Thus, it is essential to monitor numerous paths in the design. Consequently, many Razor FFs and in-situ monitors will add a considerable area – which should be prevented due to cost reasons. Another indirect monitoring structure for performance screening is the use of ring oscilla- tors (ROs). Such ROs are divided into two basic variants - generic ROs and design-dependent ROs [29]. Generic ROs are made from precisely one kind of standard library cell, e.g., inverters or AND gates. Design-dependent ROs are synthesized according to the design of the chip. Several paths of the chip are being selected, synthesized, and designed as ROs. However, such RO structures occupy much area because all structures need to be placed on the chip; in contrast, functional "}

However, such RO structures occupy much area because all structures need to be placed on the chip; in contrast, functional path ROs can solve the disadvantage of the area requirement. Wu et al. [30] proposed the basic concept of functional path ROs. A functional path RO uses existing paths in the design and creates an RO structure from such paths. In the basic concept, path ROs are used to test small circuits. Further development of functional path RO was proposed by Wang et al. [31, 21] - called Path-RO . Here, the main focus is on measuring speciﬁc path delays as precisely as possible, which is only accompanied by high area and effort. However, efﬁcient implementation is only one aspect of performance screening with functional path ROs. There are millions of functional paths on a large MCU, and the path selection directly affects the quality of performance monitoring. Many previous research was conducted to characterize timing effects [35, 36, 37, 33] in functional path ROs. Rangan et al. investigated the design of ROs in terms of PVT sensitivity [38].

Rangan et al. investigated the design of ROs in terms of PVT sensitivity [38]. Therefore, the accuracy of the performance screening strongly depends on the sensitivity of the performance monitors used. [39]. In summary, there is a lack of efﬁcient and automatic implementation of functional path ROs. The implemented ROs should ﬁt into industrial design ﬂows and use the industrial test and control infrastructures like the DFT environment. Another open point is selecting the functional paths to catch the right paths for performance screening. There is also a lack of measurement data from silicon. Furthermore, last but not least, how good are the functional path ROs for performance screening? 1.2.1.

Introduction Inside the SMON module is a mix of generic and design-dependent ROs. The module is conceptualized as a compact block positioned on the MCU. The various generic ROs consist of inverter gates, NAND gates, and NOR gates from different cell libraries. The design-dependent ROs on the SMON module emulate functional paths from the design. The SMON module is designed to contain up to 255 different ROs. However, to serve as a benchmark, the SMONs contain 27 ROs that have been used in previous work ([24]). 1.3.

The described functionality is translated into a hardware description language and a synthesizable register-transfer level (RTL) representation. With a proper RTL representation, the logic synthesis is started, and the abstracted RTL representation of the functionality is then translated into a logical gate-level design called netlist . The netlist of a design is a composition of logic gates and ﬂip-ﬂops (FFs) implementing a particular functionality previously described in RTL. The RTL representation and the netlist are constantly veriﬁed to check the desired functionality [55]. Once the netlist is veriﬁed, it is further modiﬁed with the Design for Testability (DfT) process (e.g., scan insertion ), which results in a modiﬁed netlist. The DfT process enables proper testing of the manufactured chips; more details are explained in Section 2.4.1. The modiﬁed netlist is then passed to the physical design.

All setup and hold times must be within the speciﬁcations under all allowed conditions. Plenty of other veriﬁcation steps are also done, for example, the Logic Equivalence Check (LEC), Design Rule Check (DRC), IR droop is veriﬁed and cross-talk, and many more checks [55]. If there are issues with the functionality and timing of the design, an engineering change order (ECO) is usually used to solve the issue. An ECO is a process for ﬁxing any design problems in a late design stage and is typically one of the last stages in the Pre-Si phase. The ECO can cause a minor modiﬁcation in the netlist and the resulting change in the physical design. This ECO process is executed, and an incremental compilation run is performed.

Once the whole design is successfully veriﬁed, and all targets are met, the manufacturing of the MCU design is started, which is known as the tape-out . This is also the transition from Pre-Si to Post-Si phase. The manufacturing process of MCUs in advanced complementary metal oxide semiconduc- tor (CMOS) technology is a complex and elaborating process with plenty of chemical and physical steps on a silicon wafer. Multiple chips, also denoted as dies, are contained on a single wafer. After the wafer manufacturing, the MCUs are tested for the ﬁrst time, called the front-end (FE) wafer test. The wafer is mounted on a chuck during the front-end (FE) wafer test. Afterward, the dies are separated by sawing the wafer into bare dies.

Timing and Performance of digital Circuits Modern MCUs consist of numerous architectural components. A large part consists of digital circuit elements, which is also the focus of this work. Besides that, there are also memories, analog circuit parts, and various interfaces on modern MCUs. Digital circuits are built on CMOS combinational and sequential circuit elements.

The synchronous digital design uses edge-triggered FFs as sequential circuit elements. The FFs are triggered by a synchronous clock signal CLK distributed via the clock tree. Thus, there can be distinguished between clock paths and data paths. The clock tree distributes the clock signal over the chip, and data paths care for the chip’s functionality. The data paths with combinational logic elements are arranged between the clock-triggered FFs.

PVT Variations The Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) variation signiﬁcantly impacts the timing of digital circuits, and it is becoming more critical in shrinking technology nodes [58, 59]. The digital circuitry has to ensure error-free working within the speciﬁed PVT range. The process variation is related to the variation in semiconductor manufacturing due to the complex process steps. The voltage variation impacts the operating voltage of the CMOS transistors, and the temperature is related to the die temperature, which also has a signiﬁcant impact. In this section, PVT variations and their effects are explained. It also presents the methodology for handling the sources of variation in modern MCUs. 2.3.1.

MCUs are manufactured by multiple chemical and mechanical processes based on a silicon wafer. A sequence of different process steps is executed called photolithography. Masks are used in the steps to build CMOS transistors on the plain silicon wafer. The hypothetical number of masks for building an inverter is six; however, the number and complexity of masks used for large MCUs can be enormous. The process steps, e.g., epitaxy, deposition, and implantation, are repeated until the MCU is manufactured. The metallization and interconnects are also part of the manufacturing process. Such parts connect the sources, drains, and gates accordingly and ensure power distribution [61]. The process variation impacts the ﬁlm thickness, lateral dimensions, and doping concentra- tion, resulting in variations in channel length and threshold voltage [62]. This impacts the 12 2.

Inter-die variation Inter-die variations are process variations that affect all transistors on a die similarly, e.g., all transistors’ channel length on a die might be too long related to the speciﬁed value. Those process variations are also called global process variations. The inter-die variation is further distinguished into lot-to-lot (L2L) variations, wafer-to-wafer (W2W) variations, and die-to-die (D2D) variations [61]. The wafers are processed in stacks called lots. There might be some maintenance steps from lot to lot, impacting the process variation. The same is also for W2W variation, which causes a different timing behavior from wafer to wafer. The D2D variation is visible on the wafer; e.g., a die on the wafer edge behaves differently from the die in the wafer center, mainly caused by D2D variations in manufacturing [61].

The dies on the wafer edge have a lower frequency of the RO than those in the center. Thus there is a radial D2D variation visible on the wafer [60]. Besides such centric radial D2D variation, several other wafer signatures are present in semiconductor manufacturing, which can also lead to defects on the wafer [63]. 2.3.1.2. Intra-die variation The intra-die variations affect various parts of the chip or transistors differently. They are also known as local variations or within-die (WID) variations. The WID variations were smaller in mature nodes than the D2D variations; however, they became more important in nanometer process nodes [61, 64].

It shows that the parameter change of one device is correlated with the change of the same parameter of all other devices on the chip. The magnitude of the correlation between the parameters varies depending on their physical position on the chip. The main physical transistor parameters affected by spatially correlated variations are channel length ( L), channel width ( W), and oxide thickness ( Tox) [60]. 2.3.1.3.

Also, long wires have signiﬁcant resistance that dominates the RC delay of an interconnect. State-of-the-art MCU do have multiple layers of closely packed interconnects to cope with the design complexity on the MCU; therefore, the interconnects, and their RC delay become increasingly important [61]. 2.3.2. Voltage Variations Besides the process variation, the environmental operating conditions, such as voltage and temperature, signiﬁcantly impact the timing of the circuitry and, therefore, its performance.

State-of-the-art MCUs operate in the sub-threshold region and are even more sensitive to voltage variation. Voltage variations are categorized into two main categories: IR drop and current derivative di/dtnoise [66]. The IR drop is also called voltage drop. It is caused mainly by the resistive components. That can be either off-chip (e.g., contact resistance, imperfect power supply) or on-chip caused by PDN. The IR drop is independent of the frequency and follows Ohm’s Law. On the other hand, the parasitic inductance causes the noise of the current derivative. The switching activity of the transistors has the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the noise of the current derivative. Strong load jumps can cause voltage undershoots or voltage overshoots [66].

The voltage deviations impact the timing of the entire chip. The gate delay time is proportional to the voltage and follows the formula [67] tgateµV (VTH\u0000V)a. (2.4) Where V(VDD\u0000VSS) is the supply voltage, VTHis the threshold voltage of the transistor, and ais a technology-dependent parameter. Thus, if the Vis close to the VTH, the voltage variation does have a major impact on the timing. There is a need to monitor the voltage precisely and react to occurring voltage variations immediately in designing a robust PDN, e.g., by using considerable supporting capacities. The tolerable voltage variation often found in the literature and on product data sheets is \u000610 % of V[68, 69, 17, 61]. 2.3.3.

The temperature of the chips can be inﬂuenced by the ambient temperature or thermal hotspots on the chip itself. The ambient temperature depends on whether the chip is operated in different climatic regions (desert climate or polar regions) or how powerful the external thermal system (heating or cooling) is at the system level as well as on the application area (e.g., commercial, military) [61]. Thermal hotspots occur in high-switching active areas due to the power dissipated by the transistors. This also depends on how effective the thermal conduction of the chip can dissipate the heat from chip regions. Compared with the voltage variations, the temperature variations have a higher time constant in the range of milliseconds to seconds [69]. An increase in temperature elevates the delay of the interconnects due to their parasitic resistance. The temperature behavior of the gate propagation delay depends on the voltage, especially if the device is operated in the sub-threshold region due to weak carrier mobility [70].

If long intercon- nect delays dominate the timing behavior of a device, the device will most likely be limited at high temperatures. If logic gates dominate the timing, cold temperatures are worse. In conclusion, considering PVT variation in MCUs is crucial for reliable device timing and performance. Much effort is needed to ensure a proper function over the speciﬁed operation window. This includes that all hold and setup constraints are met. In order to achieve this, the timing behavior for each PVT case must be covered and veriﬁed during the design phase as well as validated in the Post-Si phase. 15 2. Background 2.3.4.

The ﬁrst character corresponds to the process corner of the nMOS, and the second character to the pMOS - as color-coded in Figure 2.6 [61].

The setup critical timing paths are typically suspected in the slow corners, whereas the fast corners face hold time violations. The term static refers to the circumstance that the design is analyzed in a static condition by not taking care of any input or output data - which is the case in performing a simulation. The STA is performed as one of the last steps before tape out to ensure the design’s timing closure. EDA tools exist to accomplish an STA on the design and identify weaknesses.

Modern MCUs operate with a clock frequency of several hundred megahertz. In operating mode with such high frequencies, electromagnetic cross-talk can occur, which impairs the signal integrity and, thus, the timing behavior. That electromagnetic cross-talk is, in most cases, an aggressor-victim scenario where the noise and emission of one particular region affect another region in which the timing error occurs [54]. The second added margin is the safety margin for aging. The MCU manufacturer has to ensure proper function in the delivery status and at the end of the life of the MCU. Several aging effects become more important in shrinking technology nodes, such as negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI), which also affect the timing behavior of the circuit [34, 77, 78].

There are approaches to testing digital logic built-in self-test (LBIST) and on-board memory built-in self-test (MBIST), and those methods can also perform in-ﬁeld tests [55]. 2.4.1.1. Scan Test Scan test is a standard technique used in digital MCUs nowadays. This is a structural test method to detect defects in the circuit deterministically. In order to realize this, some scan infrastructure is necessary. This process is called scan insertion. 19 2. Background Scan Insertion The scan insertion is done in two steps. First, the FFs and latches in the design are replaced with the so-called scan FFs . The scan FF is built with a multiplexer (MUX) and an ordinary FF; the scan FF is shown in Figure 2.7. CLKD Q0 1 CLKQD SI SE Figure 2.7.: Scan FF contains an ordinary FF and a MUX.

The scan_en controls whether the latched input data of the internal FF captures from D input - called functional (or mission) mode- or the data is captured via the scan_in port - called scan mode. The second step is the connection of the previously placed scan FF to the so-called scan chains .

This is repeated until the last output of the scan FF within the scan chain, which is the scan_out - the output of the scan chain. Large MCUs contain a large number of scan chains. The scan_en is valid for all scan chains. 20 2. Background If the MCU is in scan mode (scen_en is high), the scan chains are sequentially loaded with 0 or 1 until all scan FFs have the desired value. After that load phase, the scan_en is switched off, and one or more functional at-speed pulses occur, called launch and capture. Once this is done, the scan_en turns on again, and captured values are unloaded from the scan chains. Such unload values are compared with the expected values. The MCU passes the test if every captured value equals the expected value. Such scan test procedure is shown in Figure 2.9.

This provides controllability and observability for every scan FF during the scan test. Scan Compression The scan chains become more extensive since more sequential scan FFs are included to cover the entire MCU. This would result in long scan chains and high effort to load and unload all scan chains with the scan pattern. Scan compression is an efﬁcient method to reduce the length of the scan chain and subsequently reduce the test time by introducing a decompressor and compactor.

Fault Models The test vectors/ scan patterns are not randomly chosen sequences of bits; instead, the test vectors are associated with fault models. Fault models are a formal abstraction where a fault is a logic description of the effect when a defect is present in the digital logic circuitry of the MCU. Dedicated test vectors are calculated using such fault models to test the digital logic for correct functionality. Such fault models aim to ensure defect-free circuitry after applying all variants of the dedicated fault model to all gates of the logic circuit. The metric to quantify the covered defect-free logic is called fault coverage . The fault coverage is calculated for each fault model, and several fault models are in use.

There are two classes of fault models: static fault models and dynamic fault models. Static fault models focus on static defects in the circuitry independent of any timing constraint. Commonly used static fault models are the Stuck-at-Fault model and the Bridging-Fault model [80, 81]. Such fault models are also used for IDDQ tests. Dynamic fault models, in turn, consider the circuit’s timing behavior and are executed at speed. Widely used dynamic fault models are the Transition Fault, Gate Delay Fault, and Path Delay Fault Models. The Transition Fault model and Gate Delay Fault are aiming localized timing faults within the logic circuit. The path delay fault model considers the timing behavior of the entire path. The path delay fault model is used in this work and described in detail in the following. Path Delay Fault Model The path delay fault model [82] aims to check if the path’s timing is met within the clock cycle. In order to do this, the path delay fault model is executed at speed in the capture phase in contrast to the sequence shown in Figure 2.9.

In addition, the side input needs to be on a non-controlling value. Once these requirements are fulﬁlled and the path is sensitized, the launch pulse is executed at the launch point; this is a controllable and observable point in the circuitry - a scan FF. The launched transition is then propagated through the sensitized path and is captured with the second clock pulse - the capture pulse - at the capture point, which is usually also a scan FF.

If the expected values equal the actual values, the path delay test is successful. The path description to be tested must be provided for every path delay test. The path delay fault patterns are distinguished in several modes based on sensitization criteria. The weakest path sensitization is functional sensitizable, which means that the path propagates the transition during the test, but the side inputs do not need to be stable. The non-robust mode ensures that the side inputs are only on a stable non-controlling value during the capture clock pulse. The tightest mode is the robust one, which requires stable non-controlling values at all side inputs during the launch and capture clock pulse [83, 84]. There is also the additional option of the hazard-free mode, which is even a little stricter than the robust mode.

In this mode, an attempt is made to prevent glitches and reconvergence in the path [68]. Dependent on the sensitization mode chosen, it becomes more challenging to calculate a path delay test pattern that fulﬁlls all sensitization requirements. In addition to the sensitization mode, the clock handling can also be adjusted, the launch- off-shift (LOS) and launch-off-capture (LOC) mode [85, 86]. The LOC method was implicitly introduced in Figure 2.11. Such a mode allows a clear distinction between shift and capture - the shift phase cares for path sensitization, and the two at-speed clock pulses are executed in the capture phase. Instead, LOS squeezes the launch clock pulse into the end of the shift phase. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages [68]. Due to strict separation in shift and capture, the LOC will be the essential mode in this work.

An ATPG tool is a software tool that generates test patterns for a given MCU design. The ATPG tool requires the netlist of the design with the already placed scan infrastructure. Based on the fault model determined, the ATPG tool calculates scan patterns to achieve high fault coverage for a wide range of potential faults in the circuit.

The clock signal is also controlled via the ATE, as well as the comparison of the scan_out values with the expected values is checked on the ATE. Such MCU testing can be done on the wafer level where the pads on the die are connected with needles from a probe card to the ATE or with package MCU which is then mounted on a socket through the ATE. With the ATE, fast, precise, and automated execution is enabled [87, 55]. 2.5. Performance testing In this section, the performance testing is explained.

The term speed binning is also used for this approach which suggests an instantaneous sorting in categories according to the speed of the devices. The performance testing of large modern MCUs is challenging due to the complex design and PVT variations. Structural dynamic scan patterns (see Section 2.4.1.1 - transition fault pattern, path delay fault pattern) are not suitable for precise performance testing. This has two reasons, the scan patterns provide only a pass/fail criterion, and second is not possible to determine the unique performance limiting paths. Many near-critical timing paths are in modern MCU designs, resulting in a timing wall. As a result, it is practically impossible to determine the path that is causing the performance limitation on large MCUs. Therefore, other approaches are necessary to determine the performance of the chip. The following sections present two commonly used methods which are central pillars of this work.

Note that the performance testing does not aim to detect devices with physical defects (e.g., shorts, opens); structural scan tests are used for this purpose. 24 2. Background 2.5.1. Performance Monitors One way to determine the performance of a chip is to use indirect performance monitors [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 21]. Such performance monitors are ring oscillators (ROs). An RO is an odd number of Ninverting logic gates connected serially, forming a closed loop. The basic structure of an RO using inverter gates is shown in Figure 2.12. 1 2 3 4 N out • feedback loop Figure 2.12.: Basic principle of an RO using inverter gates. Each logic gate in the RO and the interconnects in between add delay to the overall timing of the RO. A positive or negative edge is launched at the start of the RO once the power supply is switched on, and the signal propagates through the logic gates in the RO. Due to the odd number of logic gates and, therefore, the implicit inverting behavior of the RO, the positive/negative edge becomes inverted at the end of the RO. Then th"}

Due to the odd number of logic gates and, therefore, the implicit inverting behavior of the RO, the positive/negative edge becomes inverted at the end of the RO. Then the inverted edge is propagated through the feedback loop, triggering the next negative/positive edge. This results in a continuous oscillation where the frequency of the RO is the critical metric that is measured on the output. The oscillation frequency fof an RO is expressed as f=1 2TRO, (2.5) where TROis the delay time of the RO. TROis calculated as follows, TRO=TGate\u0001N+TLoop. (2.6) TGateis the propagation delay for each of the Ngates in the RO, and TLoopis the interconnect delay. The timing of the gates used in the circuit behaves similarly to those used for the ROs. This is why such ROs can be used as indirect performance monitors. In order to utilize ROs for performance testing, more than the basic RO structure shown in Figure 2.12 is needed. Thus there are various RO designs proposed and analyzed in literature. A fundamental distinction can be made between the two types of ROs: generic ROs and design-dependent ROs [29].

A fundamental distinction can be made between the two types of ROs: generic ROs and design-dependent ROs [29]. Generic ROs consist of a homogeneous logic gate type, e.g., inverter or NAND gate. Standard gate libraries used in large MCUs designs typically consist of several standard logic 25 2. Background gates in different driver strengths and further variations in the number of inputs/outputs and threshold voltages. Building one RO out of each used logic gate in the cell libraries would result in hundreds of generic ROs. Another way is to leverage the design information of the chip and build so-called design-dependent ROs. Such ROs aim to mimic the design of the chip. In order to do this, several methods are used, from straightforward path replicas to sophisticated synthesis algorithms considering the entire PVT space [38]. In the end, the performance test’s accuracy and quality highly depend on the sensitivity of the performance monitors used [39, 88]. Also, the value of Nhas a signiﬁcant impact.

The visibility of D2D and WID process variation within an RO depends on the number of logic gates Nin the RO. Especially for smaller technology nodes ( <40 nm ), the WID variability is only visible with short ROs containing less than 10gates. In comparison, the D2D variation is independent of N[88, 89]. Such ROs follow the process variation, usually Gaussian distributed [90]. In addition, Nalso affects the oscillation frequency, which is a considerable limitation for the frequency measuring gear and the resulting accuracy, and each additional gate contributes to the leakage current, which is also a critical variable in MCU requirements [87]. 2.5.2. Functional Testing Another fundamental approach in performance testing is the execution of functional tests. A functional test is named due to the fact that the functional test cases are executed on the MCU. Such functional test cases simulate different workloads or functional test cases of the MCU to ﬁnd defects and complement structural testing [10].

The functional test is distinguished into two subgroups. The ﬁrst method is the traditional functional testing where small code pieces are uploaded to the MCU on the automatic test equipment (ATE) and executed. The second method is the system-level test (SLT). The SLT is a time-consuming test where the MCU is mounted in an application-like board, and several test cases are executed. Such test cases can be customer application test cases of reusing veriﬁcation stimuli [13]. SLTs require lots of test time and are challenging in high volume production [25]. In contrast to the structural scan test, traditional functional testing and SLT do not have straightforward coverage metrics, making it difﬁcult to determine the testing quality [13]. In order to use the functional test for performance testing, there is a particular procedure. The clock frequency (execution frequency) of the DUT is executed at a low frequency in an inﬁnite loop. Then step by step, the clock frequency is increased. This is continued until the maximal execution frequency without a failure.

Background 2.6. Machine Learning in IC Testing 2.6.1.

ML facilitates computers (machines) to learn from existing data and predict the outcome of non-seen data without explicitly programming the computer. ML uses mathematical and statistical methods to identify the provided data’s patterns, relations, or similarities. The ﬁeld of ML has been rapidly increasing in the last decades. Meanwhile, ML-based techniques can be found in numerous applications and industrial scenarios. The scope of ML is to ﬁnd a function fthat describes the relation between the input data x and the output data y:f:x7!y.

Thus the input data xand output data yare vectors. Each input xiis called a feature , and the output yiis called a label. In order to create an ML model, the provided dataset is split into a training set Sand a test setT(or validation set). The training set is used to train the ML model, which means ﬁnding a suitable approximation function that maps the features of Sto the labels. Once the training is done and the ML model exists, the ML model is validated. The ML model validation feeds unseen features from the test set Tinto the ML model, and ˆyjis calculated. Then the ˆyjand known yjdeviation from the test set is compared. The ML model is scored depending on how well the predicted data and the known data ﬁt. Scoring metrics are, for example, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE). ML can be divided into different subﬁelds as shown in Figure 2.13.

Supervised ML is the learning approach in which the features are mapped to the labels, and the ML model is considered a black box. Such a supervised learning algorithm aims to calculate a model that maps the input to the output data. Using the trained ML model, it is possible to predict the outcome of non-seen data using only the input data. The supervised ML can be categorized into classiﬁcation and regression [92]. 27 2.

In contrast, regression-based ML provides continuous numerical values for the output variable. They are often used to make precise numerical predictions. Unsupervised ML is applied when only features are available for the training, and the labels are unknown. Thus it is not supervised by the labels - therefore, unsupervised. This type of learning intends to ﬁnd patterns and statistical dependence in the features without prior knowledge of the outcome. Two often used unsupervised methodologies in ML are clustering and dimensionality reduction [92]. Clustering describes the process of dividing a dataset with features into groups or clusters with the same or similar characteristics. The clustering algorithm uses distance-based, density- based, or hierarchical approaches to cluster the dataset into distinct groups [93, 94, 95]. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction intends to transform (or ﬁlter) the features into a reduced feature set. This should be done by keeping valuable information from the dataset.

Machine Learning in Testing Modern MCUs have become larger and more complex over recent years. This results in higher effort in testing to ensure the same or even higher quality. ML has become a well-established method for making testing more efﬁcient and manageable in the testing of MCUs [97, 98]. However, once ML is applied to real-world problems, it can help and harm. One of the most crucial things in ML applied to test is the choice of the training set. On the one hand, it shall identify outliers that are a risk for proper training. On the other hand, the trained ML model shall be robust and able to generalize. Thus, ML helps to determine devices in pass and fail and many other areas in testing.

Nevertheless, there is a solid strive to ensure zero defect quality, which means 0 DPPM accepted [101]. One of the most essential things to ensure zero defect quality is high qualitative testing [100, 102, 6]. The outcome of semiconductor testing is either the device passes all tests, or it fails the testing (one or more tests). On the other hand, there is the chance that the testing result is not correct. Either the test indicates that the device is pass whereas the actual device should fail or vice versa. This circumstance can be visualized in the confusion matrix shown in Figure 2.14.

However, concerning automotive quality, the false positive (FP) devices are the most critical, also known as escapes, and harm the quality.

Thus, the mean is the center of the distribution, and one sis the average deviation distance from the mean value. 68% of the distribution area is between \u00061sof the mean value. Therefore, with a \u00066srange, there are at least 99.99966% in the distribution area. This corresponds in a statistical term with a defect rate of at least 3.4 defective parts per million (DPPM) - known as the Six Sigma Level [104]. The six sigma level of 3.4 DPPM assumes that a \u00061.5sshift of the Normal Distribution around the mean value is present.

Two signiﬁcant changes in the circuitry are required to create a functional path RO out of an ordinary functional path, as shown in Figure 3.1. A multiplexer (MUX) is inserted at the start point of the combinational logic path, and a feedback loop is inserted connecting the end point of the path with the start point of the path. An RO requires inverting behavior by default (see. Section 2.5.1); the same requirements apply to the functional path RO. If the functional path behaves non-inverting, an inverter can be placed along the feedback loop.

Path sensitization can be accomplished by adding supporting logic to constrain all side inputs. Such an approach leads to many additional logic gates to the design and, therefore, much area overhead, which must be prevented in the competitive MCU market. The preferred solution is to use the existing DfT environment placed by scan insertion. A commercial ATPG tool is used to compute scan patterns based on an existing scan architecture that supports all logical assignments. Commercial ATPG tools support many DfT fault models.

Thus, much effort is required, and the ATPG tool has difﬁculties handling the constraints, as it has to calculate a scan pattern (e.g., stuck-at), taking into account all constraints of the side inputs. This, however, is not possible in many cases. Dynamic fault models can support sensitization. In particular, the ATPG tool can perform dedicated path sensitization using the path delay fault model.

In addition, the LOC method [85] is needed to generate the path delay pattern. This is because a fully sequential procedure is required to sensitize and measure the functional path ROs. Approaching the sensitization problem with ATPG has the disadvantage of limited path delay efﬁciency of commercial ATPG tools, which means that only a limited number of paths can be sensitized using a suitable robust detection algorithm. Also, the LOC method reinforces such limitations due to the sequential ATPG algorithm of the ATPG tool in the LOC method [86].

Advanced Implementation Concepts The functional path RO approach saves a lot of chip area compared with conventional RO approaches and enables a promising monitor structure by utilizing the DfT scan environment. However, the automotive MCU market is competitive, and every additional gate or routing line impacts the margin in the subsequent mass production of such MCUs. Therefore, this section focuses on concepts to implement the functional path ROs more efﬁciently to (i) minimize the impact on the functional circuitry and (ii) require as few additional gates and routing lines as possible.

In doing so, the natural properties of the circuit are exploited by an intelligent combination and selection of functional paths. 3.2.1. Circuitry-Wise Optimization The functional paths are distributed across the MCU. The idea of circuit-wise optimization is to ﬁnd functional paths that inherently cause low routing overhead if they are implemented as ROs. Each functional path RO runs from the launch FF to the capture FF; both FFs are scan controlled. In state-of-the-art large MCUs, many such FFs are multi-bit FFs. This means they have numerous in- and output pins using the same synchronous clock signal. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that some functional paths share the same FF using different pins. There are four types of path topologies identiﬁed that indicate lower routing effort. The goal is to ﬁnd functional paths which share the same FFs. The four types are shown in Figure 3.4.

In that case, they can share the feedback loop because only one RO is activated during functional path RO measurement. Therefore, only one feedback loop is necessary for path topologies in Type 2. Furthermore, also only one routing line for the observe signal is needed. Type 3 (Figure 3.4c) and Type 4 (Figure 3.4d) are less restricted scenarios of Type 2.

Instead of simultaneously checking for the same LFF piand CFF pi, Type 3 only checks for the same launch FF, and Type 4 checks for the same capture point. The advantages are that only a single enable signal or a single observe signal is required. Each path is investigated regarding similarities of Type 1, 2, 3, 4. As described in Section 3.1 all functional paths must be sensitizable with a path delay pattern. Those functional paths, which are sensitizable and have the properties from Type 1, 2, 3, 4, are in the subsets PType 1,Type 2,Type 3,Type 4\u0012P. Another way to use topological properties is the concept of Natural Loops . Instead of looking for common FFs of the functional paths, natural loops look at the course of the paths across the chip. 3.2.2. Natural Loops The concept of natural loops is to use two or more functional paths and connect the end-point of one path to the start-point of the following path to create a functional path RO.

The circuitry is in functional operation mode as long as the MUX switches are OFF (0). Once the MUXes are switched ON (1) and both paths are sensitized, the oscillation will start through both paths. A prerequisite for this concept is that the ATPG tool can sensitize the connected paths with one path delay pattern. A modern ATPG tool tries to sensitize as many paths as possible with as few patterns as possible. Thus, one path delay pattern can be used to sensitize many paths. The patterns used for the natural loop approach must be able to sensitize at least two paths. All coordinates of each cell are known for the paths which are sensitized by a pattern. Thus, the start- and end-points of each path are known. Also, the physical length of the path can be calculated, given those coordinates. The coordinates of the start- and end-point and the physical path length are fed into an optimization algorithm. Based on the coordinate and length information, the algorithm decides whether the paths should be combined into a natural loop or remain independent functional path ROs.

A criterion of the algorithm to select the natural loops is the overall path length and the expected length of the feedback loop. If both lengths are below a certain threshold value, the paths are not considered as natural loops. The threshold value needs to be set individually for an MCU design. Another criterion is the distance from the end-point of one path to the start-point of another path. If there are paths that run in the opposite direction and have their start- and end- points nearby, they are excellent candidates for the natural loop approach. 37 3.

The prerequisite of the functional paths for such an approach is that they have to be in P- which implies the functional paths must be sensitizable with an appropriate path delay pattern. The implementations of the functional path RO published so far [40, 31, 21] require a separate enable signal that activates the oscillation. This enable signal must be generated and routed individually for each RO, which causes considerable effort, especially when implementing many functional path ROs. The self-enabling approach eliminates the need for the individual enable signal for the functional path ROs. The self-enabling approach activates the RO using the appropriate circuits and DfT methodology. The basic principle of a self-enabling functional path RO is shown in Figure 3.6, where the select pin of the MUX is connected to the corresponding launch FF LFF piof the path pi.

The control infrastructure is responsible for enabling the functional path ROs and forwarding the oscillation frequency to a general purpose input/output (GPIO) pad or counter structure. Furthermore, the control infrastructure should be scalable and must handle all implementation options. There are three options for implementing the functional path RO on the design. Option 0 needs a distinct enable and observe signal (see Section 3.1). Option 1 and Option 2 are the self-enabling approaches that reduce the routing effort but need ATPG constraints (see Section 3.3.1), or the unlock gate (see Section 3.3.2).

Implementation Flow The concept and technique of functional path ROs have been described in the preceding sections; this section focuses on implementing such structures on silicon in the industrial design ﬂow. The implementation of the functional path ROs in the design is done in two stages. First, the control infrastructure is implemented, and in the second stage, the functional path ROs are implemented. The control infrastructure is implemented in the register-transfer level (RTL) description in the early design phase. The scan-controlled FFs in the control infrastructure are part of the scan chains. Inserting them later would drastically affect the overall scan environment, which should be avoided. The enable and observe ports remain open and are not connected. The wiring of these ports will be done later.

This means it is known which area, performance, and time speciﬁcations the MCU should have, and the control infrastructure can be adapted accordingly. The hybrid solution of the control infrastructure allows, for example, the use of a certain number of functional paths RO in Option 0 - this is predeﬁned by the number of enable/observe ports. At the same time, the self-enabling approach allows the implementation of an additional, scalable number of functional path ROs in Option 1 or 2. Therefore the ﬁnal number of implementable functional path ROs is very ﬂexible and independent of the deﬁned size of the control infrastructure. Example : The control infrastructure consists of 5scan FFs ( 32one-hot encoded ports). Thus, 31functional path ROs can be implemented in Option 0, and port number 32is for the general enable signal for Option 1 or 2. This allows any scalable number of functional path ROs to be implemented in Option 1/2.

The ECO implementation process starts in a late design phase after synthesis and place-and- route have been performed. At this stage, the paths of the design do not change considerably, which is an essential prerequisite for a smooth implementation process.

The ATPG tool attempts to sensitize each functional path with a robust path delay pattern. Only a subset of the initially passed path list can be robustly sensitized.

Thus, a substantial proportion of paths start with the same launch FFs. However, all paths ( 27 374 ) use unique capture FFs. On the other hand, 600paths are completely independent, which means those paths that use neither any shared start FFs nor the capture FFs. The same magnitudes of the number of paths related to the analyzed path types are also observed after path sensitization with the 53 3. Functional Path Ring Oscillators ATPG tool. In the end, 1970 functional path ROs are of Type 3 and can be implemented as functional path ROs. If the three modules are compared, Type 3 is the only possibility to use the path analysis. Finally, such an analysis is highly dependent on the actual design. 3.6.3.2.

The following section presents the results of the self-enabling approach. 3.6.4.

In addition, an estimation is given for a feasibility study for implementing Option 2. 55 3. Functional Path Ring Oscillators 3.6.4.1. Self-enabling Option 1 First, the self-enabling check is applied to determine how many paths are suitable for implementation in Option 1 - which requires ATPG constraints. Second, routing reduction estimation is performed to compare the implementations of Options 0 and 1. An STA report is requested in a late design stage from each of the three modules. Then, the implementation ﬂow starts and determines how many paths can be implemented in Option 0 and Option 1. The results are shown in Table 3.8.

In the modules A and B, the ATPG tool can sensitize less than 10 % , while in Module C, the ATPG tool can sensitize over 30 % . However, for large automotive MCUs, there are still enough paths left for RO implementation. The last two lines in Table 3.8 show the subset of functional paths that are suitable for the self-enabling approach ( eP) and those that are only suitable for implementation in Option 0 ( ˆP). It can be observed that a large number of the paths in Pare also suitable for the self-enabling approach. This shows that Option 1 is a feasible implementation approach for large MCUs. The number of paths in the subset for Option 1 basically depends on how the ATPG tool can handle the constraints; this, in turn, depends strongly on the DfT scan environment, the chip size, and the scan compression used.

The reduction in routing is then estimated to quantify the beneﬁts between Option 0 and Option 1 in terms of routing. For estimating the routing effort, the Manhattan Distance is used, which is the sum of the absolute distance of the Cartesian coordinates. This distance is assumed to correspond to the worst-case scenario for routing. There are eight paths selected from each of the three modules. The functional paths are chosen from the subsets ePand implemented in Option 0 and Option 1. All paths are selected to be spatially distributed over each module.

In contrast, the self-enabling approach Option 1 is used in Figure 3.19. As a result, the control signal becomes obsolete. In order to provide a fair comparison of the routing overhead, the XOR tree is also summarized at the control infrastructure. In this example, routing can be reduced by close to 70 % in Module A and C and over 77 % in Module B. Routing reduction was simulated for all three modules with a larger number of functional path ROs in Option 1 compared with Option 0. The paths were chosen to ensure spatially distribution on the chip. The results are shown in Table 3.9. Table 3.9.: Routing reduction of the RO implementation for Option 1 . Impl.

Particularly in Module C, which had a stretched rectangular shape, the routing reduction declines again ( 1percent point) in the case of 150implemented paths. It is assumed that modern EDA tools can further reduce the routing overhead by optimizing the XOR tree for the observe signal. The general enable signal was neglected in the previous routing simulation in Table 3.9. In order to estimate the routing overhead of the general enable signal, the dimensions of respective modules were considered. The general enable signal must expand over the entire module if all ROs are distributed over the entire module. This is simulated by calculating the diagonal of each module and adding three factors (1x, 1.5x, 2x) to the original routing reduction.

For each factor, a separate calculation is done to see the impact of the general enable signal. The resulting overall routing reduction and the deviation from the previous estimate are shown in Table 3.10. For a few implemented functional paths ROs (for example, 8ROs), the general enable signal has a non-negligible inﬂuence. This is true for all three factors, especially for the twofold factor of the diagonal. However, if a more signiﬁcant number of functional path ROs are implemented, the inﬂuence becomes negligible and is around one percent for 150 implemented ROs. Thus, the general enable signal is negligible for a high number of ROs, indicating the method’s scalability. As a result of the routing reduction due to the self-enabling approach, the cell utilization can be increased, thus reducing the overall area of the chip. In addition, a large part of the signal buffers required for long routing distances can be eliminated, saving area and leakage. 58 3.

Option 2 is feasible since adjacent FFs can be found, but as far as the actual routing savings are concerned, no statement can be made. As a general rule for the three modules of the large automotive MCU, Option 1 is the preferred solution, and Option 0 is suggested as a backup. 60 4. Path Selection Methodology 4.1. Selection Flow This chapter deals with the selection of functional paths and introduces a methodology that uses physical design data in order to determine functional paths for performance screening. An essential step in the implementation of the functional path RO is the selection of the appropriate paths that contribute to the performance prediction. This path selection is independent of the implementation option (Option 0, 1, or 2), since only the functional path itself is important. Path selection aims to ﬁnd paths that represent the performance of the entire chip by trying to select a diverse set of p"}

Characteristics are deﬁned using the designers’ knowledge and previously published research [36, 37, 38, 88, 17]. 61 4. Path Selection Methodology The cell count (characteristic chi1) is the number of individual cells within the path. The cell count is calculated as follows chi1=n å k=11gk2pi (4.1) where gkrepresents the logic cell of the the design. This characteristic is beneﬁcial to cope with process variations. The process variation, in general, can be divided into die-to-die (D2D) and within-die (WID) variations (see Sec- tion 2.3.1). Whereas the D2D variation affects all die transistors, identically, the WID variation affects each transistor individually. Paths with low cell count are more sensitive to WID varia- tion, whereas paths with high cell count balance the WID variation and are more sensitive to D2D variation [88].

The accumulated cell driver strength chi2is the sum of the strengths of each cell on the path, and can be expressed as chi2=n å k=1Pgk2pi. (4.2) Each logic cell has a certain driver strength Pgk. The driver strength depends mainly on the load to be driven by the cell, i.e. how many other logic cells are being supplied by the output of the driving cell, which is also called fan-out. The higher the driver strength is, the more fan-out the cell has. Considering multiple driver strengths is advantageous to monitor nonlinearities within the cell characteristics. Only some operating conditions are characterized in the cell char- acterization of the standard cell library. If an operating condition is needed between the characterized conditions, the cell behavior is interpolated based on the available data. Thus, potential nonlinearities are not captured.

The STA report contains all the coordinates of the cells along the path; therefore, the distance can be calculated as follows chi3=n å k=1dgk2pi.

In order to reduce the complexity and merge similar paths, the functional paths are clustered into so-called buckets according to the chosen path characteristics. Each functional path is assigned to a particular bucket. In total, there are NbucketsB=fB1, . . . , BNg. There are several algorithms for this unsupervised clustering problem. The K-means algorithm is used, which is a distance-based unsupervised methodology [93]. The algorithm aims to group paths with similar path characteristics. This is a multivariant optimization problem. The number of buckets is determined with the elbow criterion [94]. The K-means algorithm starts with only one bucket, and the within-cluster-sum-of-squares (WCSS) is calculated as a measure of within-cluster variance. In the case of N=1, the WCSS is the highest. The algorithm run is repeated by increasing the number of buckets, and the WCSS starts to decrease. The relation between the WCSS and the number of buckets results in a graph with an elbow shape.

Other cluster algorithms can also work ﬁne, e.g., the density-based DBSCAN [95]; that depends mainly on the dataset and the algorithm’s settings. For the distance-based clus- tering (e.g. K-means), it is essential to standardize the characteristics set previous to the clustering [107]. Each bucket contains paths that appear similar according to the speciﬁed characteristics. The main target of the cluster approach is not to have sharp disjunct buckets, which would be impossible due to the high correlation among the characteristics. The intention is instead to cluster structurally different paths; therefore, the speciﬁc choice of a particular algorithm (distance-based, density-based, or hierarchical-based) to perform the clustering has only a minor inﬂuence on the results.

The ﬁnal selection of paths to be implemented as ROs in the design is made after clustering. There are three different ways of handling this. One way is to randomly pick a path from each of the Nbuckets and select a ﬁnal subset for the implementation. Such an approach is straightforward, and a subset of paths has, by 63 4. Path Selection Methodology default, a diverse mixture of path types because the paths are out of the different buckets. The second way of selecting the ﬁnal subset is a more sophisticated approach that involves the coordinates of the paths. This ensures that the ROs are spatially distributed, in addition to being from different buckets. For example, some paths from the same bucket are picked, but the paths are spatially distributed across the chip. The third way takes a step back to clustering. The results of the elbow method are ignored, and the number of buckets is chosen according to how many functional path ROs are to be implemented.

The used set of the functional paths to demonstrate the path selection and clustering is eP. The characteristics are already extracted during the pre-processing. There are 10charac- teristics extracted from each path. Thus, the matrix of Module A has the dimensionality of 10\u00021362, because the set contains 1362 paths (see Table 3.8). On each of the three modules, the K-means cluster algorithm is started to group the paths in individual buckets. In order to determine the suitable number of buckets, the elbow method is used. The results are shown in Figure 4.2. 0 5 8 10 15 20 25 30 Number of Buckets50100150200250300WCSSElbow plot Module A data (a)Module A 0 5 8 10 15 20 25 30 Number of"}

These clock pulses are the launch and capture at-speed pulses from the path delay pattern. After the at-speed pulses, the shift-out phase starts. Since the individual patterns are merged, the ﬁrst pattern’s end is the start of the second pattern. Thus after the shift-out phase, there is a smooth transition into the shift-in phase of the second pattern. After the shift-in phase of the second pattern, the second functional path RO oscillates and is measured. This procedure is continued until all functional path ROs are tested. The veriﬁcation is successful when all functional path ROs inserted via the ECO have been tested and oscillated. Thus, the functional path ROs are correctly implemented, and the design is released for tape-out. 5.1.2. Test-limit Extraction As mentioned, the gate-level simulation has an additional beneﬁt.

PRE-Silicon Veriﬁcation and Validation In productive design ﬂow, such ECO runs are grouped and executed together, and some iteration ECO runs are needed if some parts of a design need special treatment. Such large automotive MCUs are developed with a large team of engineers where everyone is responsible for only a tiny design part or issue. Therefore, as a matter of fact, implementing the functional path ROs as the very last step before tape-out is difﬁcult. As a result, the design might change at the last minute when the functional path RO implementation is already done. In order to check the inﬂuence of implementing the functional path ROs before the tape out of the MCU, the associated changes are reviewed. The functional path ROs are implemented in the ECO phase, where also other ECOs are executed. Therefore, the extracted path characteristics are compared pre- and post-tape-out.

Impact due to driver strength (Figure 5.5c) is slightly higher. Increasing driver strength indicates that timing issues have been ﬁxed in the ECO runs. Either buffers have been inserted with contributions now to the driver strength of the path, or logic cells have been replaced by cells with a higher strength that can drive higher loads.

Static and Dynamic IR drop is investigated to verify the MCU’s power delivery network (PDN) and ensure uniform distribution of VDD and VSS on the chip. A tool such as Ansys RedHawk-SC [108] is used for such investigations and is equipped with a graphical interface that shows the switching activities and the IR drop on the ﬂoor plan.

Thus, this Pre-Si validation ﬂow is proposed to get early feedback from the selection ﬂow. Then, there is no need to wait until the ﬁrst silicon is available. The validation of the selection ﬂow can be done either by simulating the paths or with the measurements on silicon. As mentioned, if the measurement approach on silicon is chosen, there is a certain amount of downtime until the sample measurements are available for a statistically relevant basis.

The voltage and temperature sensitivity of the SPICE models are investigated with a transient analysis. Here, the voltage and temperature conditions are varied in discrete steps over the speciﬁed operating range provided in the datasheet of the MCU.

Improvement of the Heuristic Selection The heuristic process of selecting paths based on physical design data, explained in Section 4.1, may result in some functional paths that are sensitive to speciﬁc parameters not being selected as functional path ROs. This deﬁciency in path selection is that the deﬁned characteristics do not adequately cover speciﬁc parameters that affect performance.

However, the process parameters consist of a large number of individual parameters. Some individual process parameters dominate the sensitivity analysis of a functional path. Different individual process parameters may be dominant if other functional path ROs are considered. Thus a bunch of randomly selected sensitizable functional paths is fed into the model extractor, and SPICE models are generated, as in Figure 5.8a. The resulting SPICE models are analyzed for their delay sensitivity concerning the process parameters. Assuming that this sensitivity analysis results in certain path types with a very high sensitivity to precisely one or more process parameters, they can be analyzed with respect to the physical design characteristics and new selection features can be deﬁned. In this way, new features can be added to the path selection process, and the heuristic selection process can be continuously improved. 5.3.4.

The portions of the individual process parameters have been cumulated. Thus, some paths are more sensitive to the process than others. By combining the results, the heuristic path selection process ﬁnds paths with different frequency sensitivities with respect to the whole PVT conditions, which was also the intention of the methodology. Note that the absolute frequency change varies signiﬁcantly within PVT conditions. Much of the frequency change occurs due to the variation of voltage and temperature - voltage, in particular, has an enormous impact.

PRE-Silicon Veriﬁcation and Validation The majority of the paths have low sensitivity because they were randomly selected, but a few paths are very sensitive (Path No. 9 & No. 27). Such sensitive functional paths will be further investigated to determine if additional features for the physical design data-based path selection can be derived. For example, if a particular cell topology is very sensitive, the physical design data-based path selection can be optimized to consider these cell topologies in the selection as well. In this way, the heuristic path selection is improved with this feedback and is ready for future derivations and designs. 82 6.

PRE-SI Summary This part explains and illustrates the Pre-Silicon activities to implement, select, and validate functional path ROs. For this purpose, the most essential segments are divided into three chapters. Chapter 3 presents the basic concept of the functional path RO, including the implementa- tion methods and related infrastructure. The basic implementation of functional path ROs is presented and illustrated by two functional paths that are implemented as ROs. It is shown that functional path ROs have an advantage in terms of area and leakage current of over 96 % compared with traditional RO structures for 128implemented ROs. A proof-of-concept is conducted concerning the advanced implementation concepts. In particular, two concepts are proposed on how to select functional paths to ensure efﬁcient implementation.

The novel concept of self-enabling functional path ROs is presented, and a feasibility study is conducted. The use of the self-enabling approach can save more than 70 % of routing resources and, in some cases, even up to 80 % for the investigated MCU. Furthermore, two options are proposed for self-enabling: Option 1 and Option 2. Option 1, also labeled direct self-enabling, uses ATPG constraints of the launch FF of the path itself. Option 2 (indirect self-enabling) utilizes nearby launch FF and an unlock gate for enabling. A scan-controlled control infrastructure is introduced. Due to its hybrid properties, the control infrastructure can utilize the basic concept of functional path ROs and the self-enabling functional path ROs. The main advantage is that the sensitization of the functional path and the settings of the control infrastructure are maintained with a single scan pattern.

Once the ﬁrst silicon arrives from the manufacturing and assembly, the MCU is tested, validated, and characterized in depth. The number of produced devices in the early engineering phase is small compared with later mass production. Before ramping to volume production, the devices are extensively tested and analyzed to ﬁnd design weaknesses and test the speciﬁed functionality. The devices in the engineering phase are also manufactured as corner lots to have a considerable spread in the process parameters. An essential part of this phase is the performance characterization and development of an efﬁcient performance screening strategy for the high-volume phase. What also changes is the abstraction level. The MCU at the top-level is now considered instead of any chip partitions such as Module A, B, or C.

The functional path ROs do not aim to detect defects in the devices for which conventional structural test methods are responsible. Instead, the goal is to determine performance by considering only the frequencies of the functional path ROs. In this thesis, 22functional path ROs are implemented on each of the MCUs. The functional path ROs must be measured and validated to determine if they are working as expected, which will be explained in Section 7. The section is basically looking for the RO frequencies themselves. The Section 8 will describe the methodology of performance characterization and the development of a machine learning (ML) based performance screening. The main research question in this section is how the functional path ROs perform on the performance screening. 86 7. Measurement and Validation of the Functional Path RO 7.1.

When the functional path RO is enabled - enable signal is high - the ATE receives a handshake signal, and the digital probe card is activated. As soon as the frequency measurement is completed and the measured frequency is within the expected range, the procedure is continued with the subsequent functional path RO measurement. If a frequency is outside the expected range, the root cause of the discrepancy must be identiﬁed, which can be very broad. The measurement of the functional path ROs should be at a stable voltage and temper- ature condition to have a high reproducibility of the measurements.

Thus the functional path ROs can be measured with high reproducibility using the GPIOs and the ATE. In order to compare the measured frequency range with the expected frequency range, a statistically relevant amount of devices is measured. The measured RO frequencies are then compared with the test limits determined in the Pre-Si phase. Section 5.1.2 determined an upper fupper piand lower flower pitest limit for each RO.

This is especially true during changes in the circuitry mode, e.g., from the shift-in phase (long clock cycles ) to the capture phase (short at-speed clock pulse) [112]. Those abrupt transient events can cause voltage droop, which is hazardous to measurement where a stable voltage condition is needed. In order to investigate the voltage stability in the functional path RO measurement, the voltage of the MCU is sensed and observed with a scope. The voltage is observed at the load board of the test head, where the DUT is mounted on the test socket. The transition of the shift-in phase to the measurement phase is observed where the MUX of the respective functional path RO is enabled. The snapshot of the scope is shown in Figure 7.4.

The critical trace is the yellow signal which does not reveal any droop in the presented transition phase. That conﬁrms the Pre-Si dynamic voltage droop simulation in Section 5.2.2, where only a little voltage droop is expected at the MCU level during transient events. Thus it can be eliminated that any signiﬁcant transient effects in the supply voltage are happening in the transitional period of the phases in the functional path RO measurement. The functional path ROs’ frequencies can also visualize the die-to-die gradient over the wafers. One functional path RO is selected, and the frequency is observed for all dies on a wafer.

Performance Screening Using Functional Path RO 8.1.

Performance Screening Using Functional Path RO 8.1.1. FMAX Characterization As stated previously, the performance determination of an MCU is challenging. No mea- surement gear can measure the precise performance of a particular device in a one-shot measurement, as in voltage or current measurement. This is because the performance of the MCU depends on many conditions. e.g., use-case, PVT conditions, and many more. However, to have an initial reference set to correlate the RO data with the device performance, a set of golden devices is deeply analyzed with a FMAX characterization. The FMAX characterization determines the performance of a device with an elaborate process that is similar to a system- level test (SLT). The SLT initially tests the devices to ﬁnd defects.

The Principle Concept for Performance Screening The main objective of the performance screening is to assess if a device meets the speciﬁed performance requirements. The frequency of the RO structures as indirect performance monitors provide the input for this judgment: Functional path ROs and SMONs. Thus the quality of the performance screening depends strongly on the RO structures. The process is visualized in Figure 8.4.

The process is visualized in Figure 8.4. The RO frequencies are passed into the performance screening process, and the process decides whether the device passes or fails. The performance screening process, at ﬁrst glance, can be approximated as a classiﬁcation problem - numerical input data (RO frequencies) is used to classify the device as pass or fail. The classiﬁcation problem also has a signiﬁcant disadvantage: having a ﬁxed pass/fail border. The entire performance screening model has a ﬁxed border on which all devices are classiﬁed.

The FMAX characterization (see Section 8.1.1) includes outlier ﬁltering, so there is a very low probability that such outliers are still present in the labeled data set. The features (RO frequencies) must be within the predeﬁned upper and lower frequency limits of the production test ﬂow (see Section 5.1.2). Once the data set has passed these checks, the dimensionality reduction starts as the second part of the data preprocessing. This process aims to reduce the complexity of the feature set from a sample feature space, as explained in Section 2.6.

PCA decomposes the input feature into its principal components [96]. Thus, it analyzes how many different pieces of information are contained in a data set and how these can be mapped into their principal components without information loss, if possible. The more diverse the data set is, the more principal components are needed to represent the data set. This method is used to investigate which data set contains more information density. The dimensionality reduction approaches used in this paper aim to compare the two feature sets, the functional path ROs versus the SMONs, to clarify how good the functional path ROs are as performance monitors. 8.3.

Two fundamentally different classes of ML are used for performance screening: clas- siﬁcation and regression. Within the two classes, different algorithms are utilized. However, since there are many algorithms with as many different complexities, this work will focus on a few commonly used algorithms.The main focus is on which ROs are better suited for performance screening - with a particular emphasis on the functional path ROs. In order to get a ﬁrst overview of the two approaches, namely the classiﬁcation and the regression approach, Table 8.1 compares the two approaches.

In contrast, the regression approach provides a predicted numerical device performance, and the dedicated performance threshold value is applied afterward for a pass/fail decision. The regression model can reach automotive quality requirements using a guard banding technique. The two approaches are explained in the following two subsections. The approaches are independent of which kind of ROs are used.

Once this is done, the test set is used to validate the model and derive critical metrics, e.g., error and model quality. A reasonable split ratio of the initial set into training and test set is 2/3to4/5[113].

The sigmoid function employs the linear regression outcome, providing a probability value between 0 and 1 [113]. The higher the sigmoid function value, the higher the probability that the current device is classiﬁed as pass and vice versa. The model aims to ﬁnd a hyperplane according to which the devices are classiﬁed as pass or fail; that is, the model’s outcome. The logistic regression model fLRis trained with the set Sand evaluated with the set T. In order to measure how well the models perform, key metrics such as accuracy and F1 Score are used.

Such ranking indicated which ROs are more critical for the model. Depending on the features used (functional path ROs or SMONs), the trained classiﬁcation models provide different results, which in turn indicate how well the features are suited for performance screening. This classiﬁcation model-based performance screening is always tailored to the determined FTH. If the FTHchanges, the entire model must be retrained and replaced.

The RidgeCV regression fRidge combines a built-in K-Fold cross-validation, which is ben- eﬁcial in overﬁtting, especially in small data sets and Ridge Regression . The built-in K-Fold cross-validation divides the training set into K equal parts. Then the training uses K-1 parts, and the built-in test uses the remaining part of the training set. This procedure is repeated until all K parts are used for the built-in test. Such cross-validation in training provides a more robust model concerning overﬁtting and generalization.

The Principal Component Regression fPCRcombines the PCA and linear regression tech- niques [120]. The PCA transforms the given feature set into a new, reduced one. The dimensionality of the new feature set is determined in the PCR settings of the algorithm. The resulting new feature set is then passed to a linear regression algorithm. Furthermore, the Random Forest Regression fRFris an extension for the Random forest classiﬁer. The RFR deals with numerical values and deploys averaging and multiple decision trees to serve as a regression model [115]. Such an algorithm is different from the two models proposed before - which are based on a linear least square approach - the RFR is a tree-based approach.

The guardband intends to ensure automotive quality by considering the accuracy of the trained regression model. In other words, the guardband is the value by which the target frequency must be increased to ensure that no more than a certain false positives are in production.

Especially RO10and RO11 show a different behavior than the other ROs. The correlation of the functional path ROs concerning the SLT is the most critical metric. In order to obtain and create a high-quality ML model, the ROs must correlate as well as possible with the SLTs. Especially RO0and T0show a PCC of more than 92 %. Figure 8.8 presents the correlation heatmap of the SMONs concerning the SLTs. The SMONs also achieve a PCC in the range of 91 % by looking at T0. The overall correlation of the SMONs with the SLTs is lower than the results with the functional path ROs. Some SMONs share the same structure seen in their high correlation between themselves (e.g., SMON 19to SMON 24).

The classiﬁcation model is trained with the functional path ROs as features and the SMONs as features, respectively. For each SLT test case, a separate model is trained and evaluated.

The accuracy inT0,T4, and T8 is signiﬁcantly lower than in the other SLTs. The MCC also has a substantial deviation. However, the random forest model has a higher MCC score than the logistic regression, which also applies to the comparison of the accuracy of the two models. Therefore, the random forest is the preferable model in nearly all SLTs. The results using the SMONs as features are presented in Table 8.5.

The results using the SMONs as features are presented in Table 8.5. There is no signiﬁcant difference compared with the functional path ROs. In some test cases, the SMONs perform better; in other test cases, the functional path ROs are better. Therefore a third run uses the combined features set (functional path ROs and SMONs). The results are shown in Table 8.6. Also, in this case, the accuracy and MCC depend on the SLT. There is a slight beneﬁt, e.g., inT0, with respect to both scoring metrics. The MCC overall shows slightly higher results in the combined data set. The functional path ROs and the SMONs provide good accuracy in the performance screening using the classiﬁcation-based approach. The classiﬁcation-based screening provides a satisfactory result to get a ﬁrst estimation of the accuracy achieved in the performance 108 8.

The cumulated mean decrease in impurity reveals that some dedicated ROs ( RO0,RO2, SMON 3, and SMON 8) have substantial importance in predicting some SLTs. The regression-based results suggest that the functional path ROs provide good perfor- mance screening results; however, the SMONs in most SLTs give a more satisfactory result. A reasonable performance screening can be made with both types of ROs, which meet the auto- motive quality requirements. Performance screening with the highest accuracy is achieved by combining the two sets of ROs. Thus, the functional path ROs are one central pillar in the performance screening ﬂow. 112 8.

The basics of performance screening and the data set needed for that are discussed. ML is used to determine the performance of an MCU based on indirect monitors such as functional path ROs. In particular, two approaches are presented: the classiﬁcation-based performance screening and the regression-based performance screening. For both approaches, the functional path ROs are used for performance screening, and in order to compare the functional path RO results with a benchmark, the SMON module is used in the same manner for performance screening. The combined dataset is used in the third use case, which means functional path RO and the SMON module. Also, several algorithms are used in the ML. The results of classiﬁcation-based performance screening show good accuracy in performance screening with all data sets used.

In some test cases, the functional path ROs are better; in others, the SMONs. Whereas with the regression-based approach, the results change. First of all, both structures (functional path ROs and SMONs) provide good accuracy in performance screening. However, the SMONs show slightly better results then the functional path ROs in most test cases. The signiﬁcant advantage is the combined data set. The combination of functional path ROs and SMONs in performance screening improved the accuracy of performance screening in all test cases, resulting in a lower screening guardband. The impact of the reduced screening guardband is evaluated on a more considerable amount of production data, and the resulting yield is shown. Using the functional path ROs as supporting monitors in the combined data set reduces the yield loss by 2.5up to 4.7percentage points.

Conclusion 10.1. Summary of Key Contributions The automotive Microcontrollers (MCUs) have high-quality requirements. This is the reason for the extensive testing of such MCUs, and one crucial test is the performance screening. The performance screening is a challenging task and requires effort. A well-established and accurate methodology uses indirect performance monitors, namely the Ring oscillators (ROs). However, the accuracy of the performance screening depends strongly on the structure of such ROs. Furthermore, traditional ROs add a signiﬁcant area and leakage overhead to the design. In this work, the functional path ROs are presented, which are on-chip integrated monitors for performance screening. This work is divided into two main parts: Part I - the Pre-Silicon part, and Part II - the Post-Silicon part.

Obstacles in an Industrial Context In addition to the many advantages of functional path ROs, such structures can lead to obstacles in the industrial environment that should be mentioned. The ECO implementation of the functional path ROs can lead to an obstacle - however, it is only applicable in the industrial context. Ideally, the MCU design passes through the design ﬂow step by step, the ECO phase ﬁxes all issues, and the functional path ROs are implemented. In reality, there is a time to market pressure, which accelerates the design ﬂow. Thus, the timeline becomes tighter in the ECO phase - one of the last steps before tape-out. The tight timeline results in the optimized ECO phase, and the functional path RO implementation is executed with some other ECO steps in parallel. The impact is shown in Section 5.2.1, which has not had a signiﬁcant impact in the test case in this thesis. However, that could be changed in other de"}

The impact is shown in Section 5.2.1, which has not had a signiﬁcant impact in the test case in this thesis. However, that could be changed in other designs. Therefore, carefully planning the functional path RO implementation via ECO is necessary. Another potential obstacle is the circumstance of the path delay fault model for path sensitization. In this work, there were no barriers due to a large automobile MCU with an extensive DfT environment. However, this might change in other designs. In this work, many functional paths can be sensitized using a commercial ATPG tool in path delay fault mode. The number of sensitizable paths and the used scan environment are crucial for this path 117 10. Conclusion sensitization.

As mentioned in Section 10.2, the sensitization using commercial ATPG tools in path delay fault mode can lead to obstacles. In order to overcome this obstacle, a particular path sensitization mode for functional path ROs is meaningful. That additional mode will not be forced to ensure path sensitization during clock events since the oscillation of the functional path ROs is clock-independent. With such ATPG mode in place, more functional paths can be enabled for the RO implementation. The ATE is used to sensitize and measure the functional path ROs. Such utilization allows the measurement of functional path ROs in the initial production state on ATE. An in-ﬁeld usage of the functional path RO"}

Such utilization allows the measurement of functional path ROs in the initial production state on ATE. An in-ﬁeld usage of the functional path ROs can be enabled by using a deterministic scan pattern on-chip. Methods to do this are proposed in [122]. Using such an approach, path sensitization and in-ﬁeld measurement of the functional path RO frequencies is possible using an on-chip counter. Such an approach can enable functional path RO for predictive maintenance and lifecycle monitoring. In the end, functional path ROs are promising and efﬁcient structures for performance screening, and they are even more powerful by utilizing ML approaches. The further work proposal indicates the potential of functional path ROs, either for more advanced performance screening or emerging applications for in-ﬁeld usage. 118 List of Figures 1.1.

These chip manufacturers use sophisticated and advanced manufacturing machinery in their fabs to manufacture chips. As experienced during the pandemic, m anufacturing unavailability is often due to the lack of critical manufacturing -related spare parts. This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms to identify significant factors contributing to manufacturing part outages (i.e., zero-bin) to keep manufacturing equipment running at total capacity within the organization . We propose clustering methods to segment the data and use logistic regression, logistic lasso regression, random forest, and kNN approaches to identify impor tant factors for those parts that could go to zero-bin. Extant research applies classic inventory management strategies based on expenditure, criticality, or usage to manage their parts' inventory throughout the year. Instead, the proposed methods explore whether predefined, static inventory parameters can predict whether a spare part reaches zero bin. To demonstrate the viability of this approach,"}

To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we present a case study using one year's worth of data from a leading chip manufacturing company . Based on the modeling approaches, a lasso -based logistic regression proved the best predictive model amongst the five clusters with lead -time, current quantity available , days on inventory (usage remained relevant), and the part's reorder point being the most significant parameters. v Table of Contents Dedication ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ....... ii Abstract ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .......... iv List of Tables ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ . vi List of Figures ................................ ................................ ................................ ................."}

The cost of these spare parts varies from cents to thousands of dollars. The COVID -19 pandemic has adversely impacte d every supply chain in every sector (Helper and Soltas ). These spare parts have a unique supply chain dep ending on the manufacturer, country of origin, repairability , and several other parameters that the supply chain department manages . Figure 1.1 represents a high-level overview of the touchpoints for each part of the supply chain. The flow chart was created by interviewing all direct and indirect stakeholders. Figure 1.1: Spare Parts Supply Chain Each s pare part used in the manufacturing plant depends on the type of machine ry. Hence, identifying a spare part begins with the need and usage of a manufacturing tool. Next, the buyer 2 manually inputs the part's inventory information (maximum and minimum quantity and reorder point (ROP) , based on historical and forecast ed manufacturing plans ). The warehouse stocks most of these spare parts as inventory items for future use. Based on the usage of these spare parts, further orders can be placed for replacement , known as th"}

Based on the usage of these spare parts, further orders can be placed for replacement , known as the 'replacement loop .' This is called a loop because , as Figure 1.1 illustrates, the part enter s a repair cyc le or 'loop.' The plant uses these spare parts from the inventory as needed . The system will analyze whether the new inventory level reached the ROP. Nothing is done if the inventory level is above ROP , and the replenishment loop continues until another part is pulled from the inventory. More spare parts are ordered to fulfill the inventory levels somewhere between the max imum and the ROP if the current inventory is below the ROP . The new spare parts tha t arrived at the systems stay in the inventory stock until the manufacturing tools need these parts for replacement or repair . Major supplier s have dedicated teams for managing their inventory levels . In contrast, a vendor -managed inventory (VMI) system manages mino r, site-specific , or niche -specific suppliers .

Both research strategies heavily rely on historical consumption to build predictive models (K B et al. , 867 ).

Clustering is an unsupervised learning methodology. Clustering is broken down further into partitioning, hierarchical, density, or grid -based clustering. Hierarchical methods help create a decision tree on where and how each cluster is related to the whole data (Aggarwal and Reddy Ch. 19). The scope of this thesis does not cover creating these decision trees; therefore, this method was not chosen. Density -based methods focus on data regions with more values centered around specific points and ignore the areas with less data (Aggarwal and Re ddy Ch. 18). Since the data proved to have several outliers, th is clustering method would not be the right fit for the dataset. Grid-based clustering is similar to density -based methods .

This form of clustering made 8 the most sense with the dataset, where each cluster would be created based on the different local points for each cluste r. Therefore, I chose a partitioning method for this case study. K-means and K -Medoids are two partitionin g type clustering methods .

K-MEANS With a defined K, the K -Means algorithm works by randomly choosing \"K\" number of centroids. Then, in a loop, each data point's distance to each centroid is calculated to properly place the data point in the cluster with the nearest centroid. Next in the lo op, the average distance of every data point in the cluster is calculated to verify that the chosen centroid for each cluster is valid. If the outcomes are different, new centroids are chosen again, averages recalculated and reverified until the centroids are accurate for each cluster, or the max number of iterations set up is met, and the loop is completed (Ahmad , 50).

Two straightforward ways of verifying the number of clusters needed for analysis are the Elbow and Silhouette methods (Burkov, 114). 9 The Silhouette method is based on creating clusters that are equally separated from each other so that each cluster contains similar elements. This means \"the silhouette score is based on the principle of maximum internal cohesion and maximum cluster separ ation (Bonaccorso Ch. 6). The Elbow method is calculated using distortion . The larger the K value, the smaller the average distortion . This inverse relationship is because e very data point will be closer to the centroid data point. However, the improvements in average distortion will decrease as K increases, and the K value at which distortion is at its highest decline is represented by the inflection point (Bonnin Ch. 3 ).

IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM – OUTPUT I met with industry experts in warehousing, procurement, commodity managers, supply chain engineers, department managers, tool engineers, and tool technicians. They all work on ensuring operations are running daily and are directly affected by zero -bins. W ith everyone working towards meeting their own goals, it is difficult for everyone to have a universal understanding of the entire process to procure and use a spare part. After identifying the various factors contributing to zero -bins, the research question had to be simplified further. By selecting one major supplier at one primary manufacturing site, the scope of the project was narrowed.

Within the supply chain, major domains such as logistics, part repositories, inaccurate data entry, tools reaching the end of life (EOL), and human error (such as shipping the wrong part) can all contribute to zero -bin inventory.

I. I NTRODUCTION With the continuous scaling of integrated circuits, fabri- cation size is shrinking in nanometer regimes. As a result, production to ensure predictable performance can no longer be guaranteed. Transistor parameters, such as channel length, gate-oxide thickness and threshold voltage, deviate from nom- inal values, thus introducing ambiguities on the optimal course to be taken in processor design. Intel lab results show a twenty-fold variation in leakage power for a 30% variation in performance based on a design in 180nm technology [1]. When looked at from the vantage point of total power, a 40%-70% variation is associated with a 20%-50% variation in frequency, as [2] reports. Due to the transistor parameter ﬂuctuations resulting from process variation, fabricated chips vary from each other in performance. Manufactured products of the same design may end up being used as high performance 1 GHz chips, or end up being used as lower-performance 600 MHz chips.

In such a manufacturing environment, the issue of speed binning is brought to the forefront. Speed binning refers to the test procedures that help qualita- tively categorize working chips into different bins according to the highest speed test that they could pass, so that chips could be offered to customers with the appropriate frequency grades [3]. For instance, the MPC7455 microprocessor has been offered in 6 grades, i.e. 6 bins: 600, 733, 800, 867, 933 MHz and 1GHz [4]. Chips in different bins are correspondingly offered with various price grades, thus delivering distinct economic returns. The proﬁt is deﬁned as follows: Profit =income \u0000cost =n∑ i=1pi\u0001ni\u0000cost (1) where nis the number of bins, piandnirepresent the price of the ithbin and the number of chips falling into this bin, and cost denotes the cost of the design. Figure 1 shows one example with 3 bins. The price is a stair-case function of Tclk delay.

As one indispensable step in system design, high level synthesis (HLS) translates the behavioral description into a corresponding register level structure description, including resource allocation (functional unit type selection), scheduling (assigning operations into clock steps) and binding (resource instance mapping) [5]. Due to the process variation, the concept of performance yield is developed and widely used as HLS optimization criterion. It describes the probability of a certain design meeting the predeﬁned performance constraints space [6], e.g. 90% performance yield means 90% of the chips statistically satisfy design constraints. A number of researchers conduct variation-aware HLS based on this yield theory to deal with process variation, like minimizing latency [7] [8] or area [9] while guaranteeing satisfactory performance yield. Our objective is to build a satisfactory circuit performance distribution ( Tclk) by HLS solutions, which determines the economic proﬁt in the context of speed binning. Fig. 1. Income calculation.

Two bins are set: bin1 is set at a clock cycle delay of 9 and bin2 is set at 12, with the price of 200 and 70, respectively. All chips slower than 12 are discarded and deliver no economic return. Figure 2(c) lists the economic features. Though S2has the lowest implementation cost, due to the uncertainties resulting from process variation, 51% of the chips are discarded, and the other 49% are only eligible for the slower bin, resulting in a com- paratively lower income, which falls short of compensating for the cost and thus delivers no proﬁt. In contrast, S1derives the best income (with 100% eligible chips sold at the higher price), yet also with the most expensive design cost, resulting in an unsatisfactory proﬁt. Consequently, a tradeoff between high income and low cost should be taken into account for proﬁt optimization.

The slowdown procedure is conducted for all clock cycles simultaneously. For example, if each clock cycle has one adder candidate to slow down, they should be degraded at the same time. Differentially slowing down a component across clock cycles consistently leads to guaranteed suboptimal solutions, as allocation is determined by the maximum cardinality of each type. Consequently, for one operation, only the global slowdown of a component in allclock cycles may conceivably deliver proﬁt1.

In the proposed strategy, scheduling starts from the most dangerous clock cycle, namely the one with the smallest dangerSlack, and excludes components out of itsnodeList to relieve the impact of overcrowding.

Secondly, it is suboptimal to exclude one FU whose ASAP (or ALAP) is the danger step, since it imposes a signiﬁcant restriction for both itself and its successors (or predecessors). Last but not least, the exclusion should bring the current clock cycle the maximum delay reduction to get this cycle a bigger dangerSlack . Even, if no delay reduction can be obtained by excluding any component because of the parallelism, the exclusion may still be reasonable because delay reduction can possibly be attained in cognition with subsequent exclusions.

The PYO strategy maximizes the chip numbers in the most expensive bin.

Monte Carlo methods are applied to simulate the inherent correlations between clock cycle distributions that share the same resource. To make the experiment consistent and efﬁ- cient, for all test benches, the clock cycle time is chosen to be18, with the two bins set at 14 and 18, respectively.

C ONCLUSION In this paper, we introduce speed binning into the HLS do- main to help derive maximal economic return. Taking process variation into account, we develop a set of HLS approaches for proﬁt maximization, including allocation, scheduling and binding. Experimental results conﬁrm the superiority of HLS results and the associated improvement in proﬁt margins, when said components follow Gaussian, Uniform and Triangle delay distributions. We also propose an optimal bin boundary selection (OBBS) algorithm, delievering a near-optimal perfor- mance. To sum it, this paper constructs both process variation aware and proﬁt aware HLS designs in the context of speed binning, delivering maximal economic proﬁt.

Furthermore, semiconductor defect datasetsoften suffer from data imbalance, where certain defect pat- terns are signiﬁcantly outnumbered by other patterns [ 9,10]. This leads to model bias and reduced detection accuracy.Most of all, technological advances increase the diversity of defect patterns, further complicating the labeling process and requiring frequent model retraining to maintain performance.

After extracting keypoints and descriptors from reﬁned defect regions of WBMs, the matching score (Mscore) is com-puted between defect patterns. Notably, this process does not require labeled WBMs, allowing the method to gen- eralize to new defect patterns without retraining a neuralnetwork model. Third, similarity calculation using the pro-posed Conﬁdence and match of defects (MoD) scores is applied. The Conﬁdence score evaluates the reliability of matched defect patterns by assessing the consistency oftheir feature representations across WBMs. A higher Conﬁ- dence score indicates a more reliable match, helping to ﬁlter out incorrect or ambiguous pattern searching.

Generally, these algorithms identify key features called keypoints in images and establish correspondences between them to enable accurate matching and alignment.Speciﬁcally, they consist of three key processes: feature detection, description, and matching. In feature detection, classical methods such as scale invariant feature trans-form (SIFT) [ 23] and oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) [ 24] detect keypoints by identifying regions with sharp changes in brightness or contrast, relying on hand- crafted operations such as difference of Gaussian ﬁltering. Infeature description, these methods then generate descriptors based on histograms of gradient orientations, ensuring invari- ance to rotation and scale.

Instead of relying on handcrafted operations, they utilize convo- lutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn keypoint rep-resentations from real or synthetic keypoint datasets. For example, [ 25–27] adopted supervised learning to train detec- tors and descriptors, while [ 28,29] employed self-supervised learning to improve the consistency of keypoint detection and description across varying conditions. In feature matching, graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms,which model relationships between keypoints beyond simplepairwise comparisons, have been widely adopted.

The detection function detects salient pixels called key- points from the defect patterns in each WBM. Then, the description function extracts descriptors around keypoints toenhance robustness against rotational and scale variations of the defect patterns.

On theother hand, the matching function matches keypoints from different defect patterns based on their descriptors. Figure 1b shows an example of the keypoint matching processes inWBM.

In [ 20,35–37], the location and area of defect patterns affect the matching resultsof defect patterns. In other words, the repetitive malfunctionof the manufacturing process is signiﬁcantly related to the defect patterns having close locations or similar areas.

How- ever, general keypoint-based image matching algorithmshave rotation and scale invariant properties. These proper- ties can degrade the results of pattern search, because the location and area of the defect patterns are not considered. To overcome this problem, we propose a WBM pre- processing method using object detection, which is per- formed in the pre-processing function in Algorithm 1. Bypre-processing, signiﬁcant defect patterns in WBMs aredetected and localized while non-signiﬁcant noise is ﬁltered out [ 35]. Our proposed pre-processing method addresses the limitations of supervised learning methods by employing thepre-processing function exclusively for denoising and defect pattern reﬁnement, rather than integrating it as a core com- ponent of pattern search or similarity analysis. This ensuresthat our approach avoids the data dependency and retrainingchallenges associated with supervised learning-based meth- ods. The details of the pre-processing function are explained with Fig. 3as follows: ﬁrstly, as shown in Fig. 3a, c, and e, an object detector builds the bounding box (denoted as bbox),which ﬁnds the location and area of the signiﬁcant defectpatterns.

Then, so-called denoising is performed to erase the non-signiﬁcant defect patterns in the WBM in Fig. 3b, d, and f. The pat- tern search can continue after performing the pre-processed WBMs from the aforementioned two steps. 3.4 Image matching with keypoints and descriptors The matching function in Line 13 of Algorithm 1 usesthe keypoints and descriptors as its inputs. The keypointsand their descriptors can be obtained from classical image matching algorithms such as SIFT and ORB. The gener- ated descriptors capture essential photometric informationof keypoints.

SuperGlue considers the positional relationships between keypoints based on graph attentionnetworks (GA Ts), enabling robust matching for both single and mixed defect patterns. The model used in SuperGlue is trained to update the weights of GA Ts extracted from thesame defect patterns. In this process, while each keypoint isrepresented as a node, the relationships between keypoints are represented as edges. Considering the above advantages, SuperPoint and SuperGlue can be mainly adopted in the pro-posed pattern searching method.

Edges for all keypoints can be denoted as j:(i,j)∈ε, where iand jindicate the indexes of any keypoints having connections via edges ε. In this case, the aggregated result from all keypoints of the source and tar-get WBMs is denoted by message msg ε→i.

Each element of the score matrix means Mscore from the matching between two keypoints. 3.5 Refining similarity measurement by adjusting Mscore with Confidence and MoD scores In the matching function, SuperGlue and several existing image matching algorithms [ 26,28,31] use the average Mscore to measure the similarity between image patterns. As far as we know, it is noted that no metric-based methods have been developed to adjust the average Mscore consider-ing the characteristics of the pattern search for defect patterns in WBMs. Therefore, we propose two similarity metrics for adjusting the matching results between defect patterns inWBMs. 123 2146 The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (2025) 138:2139–2156 3.5.1 Conﬁdence score In the pattern search of general image dataset, the scale and dimension of the target images can determine the Mscore between any matched descriptors from keypoints.

Therefore, in the matching for defect Fig. 4 Visualization of the con f s of the all matched keypointspatterns in WBMs, the naive calculation of Mscore does not consider the characteristics of pattern search in WBMsbecause each naive Mscore cannot consider the location and area of defect patterns detected from an object detector in the pre-processing function.

Instead, the defect patterns of Rank-4 andRank-5 were very similar to the defect pattern in the source WBM.

On the other hand, with the proposed MoD score, only one defect pattern in a target WBM had a label differentfrom that of the source WBM.

On the other hand,when a defect pattern appeared in the large area of a WBMsuch as Loc,Edge-Loc , and Scratch , the pre-processing can detect the defect pattern by showing large bboxes, whichproves that the trained YOLOv8 detector can be effective in ﬁnding the defect patterns that appear on the entire region of a WBM. In the search for Near-full , because the defects were scattered on the entire region, the penalty of the difference inlocations and areas in the MoD score could not be applied. However, considering the searched defect patterns and their characteristics in Table 1, the proposed pattern search using MoD score was effective in ﬁnding a single defect pattern using pre-processing. 4.3 Experiments on mixed defect patterns In Fig. 7, we conducted experiments on the MixedWM38 dataset to evaluate the "}

Whereas a single Edge-Loc in Fig. 6b can be well searched, complex extracted keypoints from Edge-Loc can disturb the search for other defect patterns such as Scratch andLoc in the search for mixed patterns. Therefore, it is con- cluded that when small defect patterns among mixed patterns were scattered on the entire region of a WBM such as Edge- Loc, the scattered defect pattern signiﬁcantly degraded the pattern search results.

Figure 8a presents a centered defect pattern from a source WBM used as the template, while Fig. 8b shows a defect pattern in the target WBM with a shape resembling the template in Fig. 8a. How- ever, when similarity is assessed using Euclidean distance, the spatial difference between the template and the defectpattern in the target WBM becomes a signiﬁcant challenge. Since Euclidean distance directly measures the displacement between corresponding pixels, even minor location shiftscan substantially impact the similarity measurement.

Besides, the defects around thewafer edge also produced the keypoints around the edge of the WBM.

To overcome the weakness of exist-ing supervised and unsupervised methods, we propose anew robust pattern search method, including pre-processing, detection, description, and matching functions. Notably, experimental data prove the effectiveness of denoising, whichfocuses on the signiﬁcant defect patterns. The similarity met- rics called Conﬁdence and MoD score adjust the Mscores of the image matching in WBMs by considering the nor-malization and the location and area of defect patterns.

This trend leads to a large timing margin and thus overdesign to maintain yield.T o combat this pessimism, post-silicon clock tuning buffers can beinserted into circuits to balance timing budgets of critical pathswith their neighbors. After manufacturing, these clock buffers can be conﬁgured for each chip individually so that chips with timingfailures may be rescued to improve yield. In this paper , we propose a sampling-based method to determine the proper locations of these buffers. The goal of this buffer insertion is to reduce the number of buffers and their ranges, while still maintaining a good yield improvement.

I NTRODUCTION At advanced technology nodes, process variations have be- come relatively larger, and thus caused expensive overdesignto guarantee yield. To alleviate the effect of process variations,many researchers have introduced special circuit components andmechanisms. For instance, post-silicon tuning components can beinserted into the circuit to alleviate the effect of process variations. Since physical parameters are ﬁxed for each individual chip aftermanufacturing, tuning at the post-silicon stage can improve the performance speciﬁcally for each chip. A widely used post-silicon tuning technique is clock tuning using delay buffers. For example, the structure of the delaybuffer used in [1] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The delay of such a buffer can be changed by setting the conﬁguration bits in the three registers. In high-performance designs, these tuning buffersare inserted during the design phase.

In high-performance designs, these tuning buffersare inserted during the design phase. After manufacturing, thedelay values of these buffers are conﬁgured to allot critical pathsmore timing budget by shifting clock edges toward the stageswith smaller combinational delays. These critical paths might bedifferent in individual chips due to process variations, so that onlypost-silicon tuning can counterbalance them effectively. With thispost-silicon tuning, chips that might have failed to meet timingspeciﬁcations can be revitalized, leading to an increased yield atthe expense of additional area required by these buffers. In this paper, we propose a method to insert post-silicon tuning buffers at the design phase for yield improvement. Thismethod uses Monte Carlo simulation to emulate produced chips and conﬁne tuning buffers to as few ﬂip-ﬂops as possible ineach sample. After the whole simulation is ﬁnished, only thosebuffers that are critical to the yield are kept in the circuit.

Here the clock buffers introduce two delay variables into the constraints (1) and (2). Without them,the two inequations fall back to the classic timing constraints ofdigital circuits. Owing to area constraints, the conﬁgurable delay of a clock buffer usually has a limited range. This range determines the size of the buffer so that it should be as small as possible. Assumethat the lower bound of the tuning values of buffer iisr iand the range of the buffer is τi. The delay value of buffer ican thus be constrained by a range window as ri≤xi≤ri+τi.

The number and rangesof buffers should be kept as small as possible. In the proposed method, we ﬁrst assume that each ﬂip-ﬂop has a tuning buffer attached. We then sample the statisticalvariables in (1) and (2) and minimize the number of buffersrequired to achieve the given clock period for a speciﬁc sample.Here a sample can be considered as a representative chip aftermanufacturing. With enough samples, the trend where buffers should be inserted can thus be recognized, and only those buffers that affect the yield signiﬁcantly are kept in the circuit. The proposed method contains three major steps. In the ﬁrst step, we allow the lower bounds of buffers to ﬂoat freely, becauseat this stage the lower bound r iin (3) is still unknown. For each sample, we minimize the number of required buffers andpush the tuning values of buffers toward 0.

Therefore, we focus on the reductionof buffer number by pushing tuning values toward 0. In the second step, the bounds of buffer ranges have been determined,so that the average can represent the trend of tuning values.Consequently, pushing tuning values toward this average mayreduce the ranges of buffers.

The challengeof this method is a large runtime, although it can be parallelizedeasily onto multiple CPU cores for acceleration. To solve theruntime problem, we introduce several techniques which canaccelerate the proposed method effectively. A. Determining lower bounds of the range windows In this step, we have no information about where to insert buffers and how to set the lower bounds of these buffers.

IV .E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS The proposed method was implemented in C++ and tested using a 3.20 GHz CPU with one thread. We demonstrate the results with circuits from the ISCAS89 benchmark set and from the TAU 2013 variation-aware timing analysis contest. To thesecircuits we also added clock skews so that they have more criticalpaths. Information about these circuits is shown in Table I, wheren sis the number of ﬂip-ﬂops and ngthe number of logic gates. We assumed that the maximum allowed buffer ranges were 1/8of the original clock period [4]. All tuning delays are assumeddiscrete with 20 steps. The logic gates in the circuits were mappedto a library from an industry partner. The standard deviations oftransistor length, oxide thickness and threshold voltage were setto 15.7%, 5.3% and 4.4% of the nominal values. The ILP solver for the optimization problems was Gurobi [6].

Most of the existing SSL approaches assume a balanced dataset and often fail to provide satisfactory results when applied to imbalanced class problems. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel Dual-Head Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that contains two classifier heads. One classifier head maximizes overall classification scores, while the other aims to maximize per-class classification scores, providing equal attention to both majority and minority classes. The proposed CNN architecture uses pseudo-labels selected based on the outputs of these two classifiers to expand the labeled training set, which is then used to retrain the CNN. In this way, highly confident pseudo-labels are selected even from the minority classes, leading to better model training. Experiments show that the proposed approach is effective in handling class-imbalanced classification of WBM defect patterns, reporting state-of-the-art classification with an F1 score of 0.918, accuracy of 98.2% and a mean per-class accuracy of 91.7% using a lightweight ResNet-10 model as the backbone on the real-world public WBM dataset, WM-811K.

Introduction Semiconductor devices are manufactured on circular slices of semi- conductor material, typically silicon, known as wafers. A Wafer Bin Map (WBM) ( Fig. 1) is a graphical representation that displays the areas of the wafer containing functional dies that meet specifications, as well as the areas that contain defective dies. The WBM is an important tool for semiconductor manufacturers, as it allows them to identify the root cause of defects in the manufacturing process. By analyzing the WBM, experts can identify patterns in the distribution of good and bad dies and adjust the manufacturing process to reduce the number of defects and increase the yield of good dies.

However, manually identifying WBM defect patterns can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Automatically identifying defect patterns in WBM is crucial for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. It enhances accuracy, reduces the time and costs associated with manual inspection, and improves overall efficiency. Several automated approaches have been proposed for WBM defect classification, most of which are based on fully supervised learning (FSL). These FSL approaches (e.g., Adly, Alhussein et al. (2015 ), Adly, E-mail address: siyam@univ.jfn.ac.lk .Yoo et al. (2015 ), Chen et al. (2023 ), Chien, Hsu, and Chen (2013 ), Piao, Jin, Lee, and Byun (2018 ), Shin, Kahng, and Kim (2022 ) and Shin and Yoo (2023 )) require large amount of labeled data to train, which is usually difficult to obtain as labeling is a tedious and costly process. In contrast, semi-supervised learning (SSL) (e.g., Kahng and Kim (2021 ), Sohn et al. (2020 ) and Zhang et al.

However, most existing SSL approaches, including FixMatch ( Sohn et al. , 2020 ), assume a uniform distribution of the number of images from different classes, which is not representative of real-world scenarios. In reality, data often follows a long-tail distribution, with the majority of images belonging to one class and many classes having very few data points, resulting in data imbalance. In such cases, most existing SSL approaches fail to provide good results as the CNN trained on class imbalanced datasets are biased towards the classes which contains the majority of the data points.

This work proposes a novel SSL approach for WBM classification. The proposed approach is based on a Dual-Head CNN architecture that is designed to handle data imbalance effectively. The proposed architecture contains two classifier heads. The first classifier head aims to maximize overall accuracy values, while the second one aims to max- imize the average of per-class accuracy values. Initially, the proposed CNN is trained using the available labeled training data. Then, it is used to identify high-confident pseudo-labels from the unlabeled data using the output from both classifier heads.

For example, in Hsu and Chien (2020 ), a weighted majority voting is adopted to ensemble CNN models to achieve higher predictive performance. In Misra et al. (2022 ), features extracted from multiple pre-trained CNN models are concatenated, and a classification layer is trained on this concatenated representation to predict the label.

However, the number of SSL approaches for WBM classification is still much lower compared to FSL approaches.

The pseudo-labeled images are then used to update each CNN in the ensemble, resulting in improved performance over FSL baseline. Self-supervised learning approaches also utilize unlabeled data to improve model’s performance. However, they typically consists of two stages: In the first stage, a contrastive loss function is used with the available unlabeled data to pretrain the model to generate rich feature representations.

Similarly, the unlabeled set can be represented as = {(𝑢𝑖)}𝑀 𝑖=1, where𝑀represents the total number of unlabeled images. The label of each unlabeled image 𝑢𝑖is unknown. It is also assumed that the distribution of the number of images from different classes follows a long-tail distribution, implying that the number of images in each class is highly imbalanced. The notations used throughout this manuscript are listed in Table 1. 3.2. Dual-head CNN When training the CNN model using the commonly employed Cross Entropy (CE) loss, without considering the issue of class imbalance, a significant bias toward the majority classes emerges. Consequently, the model tends to incorrectly classify most images as if they belong to the majority class, while selecting only a few or no data from the minority classes. Subsequent training using these erroneously chosen pseudo-labels adversely affects the model’s generalization ability, a phenomenon known as ‘‘confirmation bias’’ (Wang, Wu, Lian, & Yu, 2022). On the contrary, training the model with a class-balanced CE loss, which assigns equal importance to all classes, results in more accurate pseudo-label selection. Pseudo-labels from even the"}

On the contrary, training the model with a class-balanced CE loss, which assigns equal importance to all classes, results in more accurate pseudo-label selection. Pseudo-labels from even the minority classes are chosen in this scenario, proving highly beneficial for the subsequent semi-supervised training of the model. However, it is important to note that training a model with a balanced CE loss might not be suitable if the primary objective is to maximize the overall prediction accuracy. Therefore, in our proposed approach, a Dual-Head CNN model is introduced to effectively tackle the class imbalance issue, as depicted in Fig. 2. This model comprises two classifier heads, denoted as 𝐻and 𝐻𝑊, which share the same backbone network. The pseudo-labels se- lected from both heads are utilized for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Classifier head 𝐻𝑊is trained using the balanced CE loss to facilitate the selection of pseudo-labels from minority classes.

During testing, the classification head 𝐻can be employed to make predictions that optimizes overall accuracy values.3.2.1. Classifier head 𝐻 The classifier head, 𝐻, is focused on classifying images into a set of predefined classes without considering their imbalanced nature. i.e., 𝐻 is optimized using the CE loss function as follows: 𝛼= −1 𝑁𝑁∑ 𝑖=1𝐶∑ 𝑐=11𝑦𝑖=𝑐log𝑝(𝑦𝑖=𝑐|𝛼(𝑥𝑖),𝐻) (1) where, 1𝑦𝑖=𝑐is the indicator function which returns 1 if 𝑦𝑖=𝑐, and returns 0 otherwise, 𝛼(𝑥𝑖)is the augmented version (e.g., by applying rotation) of the image 𝑥𝑖and𝑝(𝑦𝑖=𝑐|𝛼(𝑥𝑖),𝐻)is the predicted probability of the augmented image 𝛼(𝑥𝑖)belonging to the class 𝑐by the classifier head 𝐻. The CE loss has gained widespread adoption in SSL, exemplified by its use in prominent approaches like FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020). It aligns well with the goal of maximizing the likelihood of the true labels given the model’s predictions.

By optimizing this loss function on a combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, SSL aims to enhance the model’s generalization capabilities and overall performance. However, as explained earlier, this loss function does not account for the imbalanced nature of the classes. Consequently, its predictions may be biased towards the classes which contain majority of the data. This loss function would be more appropriate if the objective is to maximize the overall accuracy or the F1-score. When this classifier is used in SSL to select high confident pseudo-labels, the majority of the selected data would be from the majority classes, resulting in few or no data selected from the minority classes. 3.2.2.

Consistency regularization enforces that the predictions of the perturbed versions of an input should be similar to each other. In pseudo labeling based consistency regularization, first the pseudo label, ̂ 𝑦𝑖, of an unlabeled image, 𝑢𝑖, is generated based on the weakly augmented version of that image as follows: ̂ 𝑦𝑖= arg max(𝑝(𝑦|𝛼(𝑢𝑖),𝐻′)) (5) That is, the pseudo-label is identified as the class which corresponds to the maximum value in 𝑝(𝑦|𝛼(𝑢𝑖),𝐻′). Here,𝐻′could be either 𝐻 or𝐻𝑊. This pseudo label is then considered as the true label for the strongly augmented version of that image when updating the CNN model which gives a form of consistency regularization.

Consequently, they are often far from the decision boundaries that distinguish different classes, resulting in high-confidence predictions. However, during model train- ing, strongly augmented images play a crucial role. These images are more challenging and tend to be closer to the decision boundaries, which aids in refining those boundaries.

Investigation of FSL under different settings This section aims to investigate (1) the suitable CNN architecture and the appropriate learning rate for each architecture, (2) the effect of the class-weighted loss function for the classification of WBM, (3) the effect of the amount of labeled training data on the performance, (4) the effect of data augmentation, and (5) the effect of batch size. Two variants of ResNet (ResNet-10 and ResNet-18) and DenseNet- 121 were considered for comparison as Resnet (He et al., 2016) and Densenet (Huang et al., 2017) were widely used for image classifica- tion.

Note that a single head CNN model is used in all the experiments reported in this section. The following are the main observations from the experiments: (1) Simpler model, Resnet-10, performs better for WBM classification par- ticularly when the training data is limited compared to a more complex model. (2) Applying a class-weighted CE loss lead to better MCA as WBM is an imbalanced classification problem; however, a better F1- score was obtained when no class weights were used. (3) Increasing the size of labeled training data leads to better classification performance regardless of the CNN architecture as more labeled data helps to learn the CNN weights better.

This is because the class- weighted CE loss assigns equal importance to each class, maximizing the MCA metric. However, using CE loss without weights results in better F1-scores, indicating that the macro F1-score is influenced by the accuracy of the majority class’s prediction. Better performance with more labels: When increasing the labeled training data classification performance improves significantly regard- less of the CNN architecture. For example, when Resnet-10 architecture is considered, an improvement of ∼ 8% in MCA was observed (from 82.9% to 91.0%) when increasing the amount of training data from 𝑝= 2% to𝑝= 10% (with the class weighted CE loss).

An improvement of 10% in MCA was obtained when applying all the augmentations (random flipping, ro- tation and cutout) compared to using only the original images without any augmentations. This improvement can be attributed to the fact that augmentations increase the size of the training set and hence, improve the generalization ability of the network. Effect of batch size: Fig. 3 illustrates the F1-scores for different batch sizes and learning rates. Batch sizes of 64, 128, and 256 demonstrate nearly identical performances (albeit with varying learning rates) when contrasted with the performance achieved using a batch size of 512. The larger batch size of 512 results in inferior classification perfor- mance. This is because the generalization ability of the network is improved by smaller batch sizes ( Masters & Luschi , 2018 ).

The results show that 𝐻𝑊provides significantly better MCA compared to 𝐻. However, 𝐻performs better in terms of F1 score compared to 𝐻𝑊.

The last row of this table reports the total number of pseudo-labels selected and their average Precision and Recall values under different settings. FixMatch ( Sohn et al. , 2020 ) (corresponds the selection based on the classifier head 𝐻) selects high confident predictions by applying a fixed threshold value ( 𝜏= 0.9) on the predicted probabilities. However, Table 8 shows that out of the total 30,458 images selected as high confidence predictions by FixMatch, the majority (27,465) belonged to the class ‘none’, with no data selected from the minority class ‘near- full’. This indicates the inability of FixMatch in handling imbalanced data and results in bias towards the majority class. On the other hand, FlexMatch ( Zhang et al. , 2021 ), a recently proposed SSL method, addresses this issue by applying per-class adap- tive thresholds based on the model’s learning status for each class to select high-confident predictions. FlexMatch selects a large number of high confident predictions, including data from the minority classes.

However, the selected data, particularly from the minority classes, are inaccurate, with very low precision and recall values (precision of 0.743 for the minority class ‘near-full’). Adding this impure data to the labeled data during model training may result in a noisy model with reduced performance. Similarly, SimiS ( Chen et al. , 2022 ), a recent SSL approach, shows improved performance over many SSL approaches, including FixMatch (Sohn et al. , 2020 ) and ReMixMatch ( Berthelot et al. , 2019 ), for imbal- anced class classification problems in Chen et al. (2022 ). SimiS uses the difference in class distribution between a particular class and the most frequent class and selects more pseudo-labels from the less frequent classes than the frequent classes.

Consequently, MCA values have been included in Table 10 to facilitate future comparisons and assessments of MCA performance within similar contexts. 5. Conclusion SSL approaches have gained immense popularity in recent years due to their ability to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data for training deep learning models. However, many existing SSL approaches assume that the training data follows a uniform distribution, where each class consists of approximately an equal number of images. This assumption often results in the failure of these methods to handle highly imbal- anced data, where the number of images belonging to one or more classes is significantly less than the others. To address this issue, this work proposes a Dual-Head CNN architecture based SSL approach for imbalanced class WBM defect classification. The proposed approach overcomes the class imbalanced problem by using two classification heads,𝐻and𝐻𝑊, where𝐻focuses on the overall classification accuracy, and 𝐻𝑊focuses on improving the accuracy of the minority classes by giving equal importance to all the classes.

Abstract: Process variations during manufacturing lead to differences in the performance of the chips. In order to better utilize the performance of the chips, it is necessary to perform maximum operation frequency ( Fmax) tests to place the chips into different speed bins. For most Fmaxtests, signiﬁcant efforts are put in place to reduce test cost and improve binning accuracy; e.g., our conference paper published in ICICM 2017 presents a novel binning sensor for low-cost and accurate speed binning. However, by promoting chips placed at the lower bins, because of conservative binning, into higher bins, the overall proﬁt can greatly increase. Therefore, this paper, extended based on a conference paper, presents a novel and adaptive methodology for speed binning, in which the paths impacting the speed bin of a speciﬁc IC are identiﬁed and adapted by our proposed on-chip Binning Checker and Binning Adaptor . As a result, some parts at a bin "}

As a result, some parts at a bin margin can be promoted to higher bins. The proposed methodology can be used to optimize the Fmaxyield of a digital circuit when it has redundant timing in clock tree, and it can be integrated into current Fmaxtests with low extra cost. The proposed adaptive system has been implemented and validated on ﬁve benchmarks from ITC, ISCAS89, and OpenSPARCT2 core on 28 nm Altera FPGAs. Measurement results show that the number of higher bin chips is improved by 7–16%, and our cost analysis shows that the proﬁt increase is between 1.18% and 3.04%.

Due to these ﬂuctuations, the performance of chips is different; hence, chips (microprocessors, DSPs, micro controllers, and sometimes even ASICs) can be placed into different speed bins [ 3,4]. Chips with higher performance are placed into higher speed bins, which can bring more proﬁt. For instance, the price of the fastest Intel PrescottTMand AMD64 VeniceTMdevice is about three times higher than that of the slowest parts [ 5]. To obtain more proﬁt, it is necessary to promote the proportion of faster chips. Hence, efﬁciently and accurately Fmaxtests are required to prevent high-performance chips from being placed into low bins. Another approach is to make efforts to promote low-end chips to higher bins and improve the proportion of high-end chips. Generally, speed binning can be achieved by performing at-speed Fmaxtests [ 6], which can be divided into functional, structural (scan-based), and sensor-based tests. The func- tional Fmaxtest is to ﬁnd the maximum operation frequency at which the chip can operate normally by applying test patterns at different clock frequencies in the functional mode [ 7]. This requires the use of high-end automated test equipment (ATE"}

This requires the use of high-end automated test equipment (ATE) to apply and analyze a large number of test patterns at high speed, resulting in high test overhead. In order to reduce the cost of testing, part of the work adopts a Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) [ 8–10] Sensors 2022 ,22, 1382. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22041382 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors Sensors 2022 ,22, 1382 2 of 18 to perform on-chip storing and analyzing of test patterns, which reduces the requirements for high-end ATE. SBST usually requires large on-chip memory storage. The structural (scan-based) Fmaxtest includes LOC (launch on shift), LOS (launch on capture), and LOES (launch on extra shift) tests [ 11–13]. During the structural Fmaxtest, at-speed test patterns are shifted through scan chains with a low speed scan clock, and then, the test is performed with one or two high-speed functional clock cycles [14–16]. The test responses are scanned out for analyzing to get the actual speed bins. [ 17] investigates the correlation between functional test frequency and th"}

Using the on-chip programmable PLL circuitry to obtain high-frequency clocks for an at-speed scan test is presented in [ 19]. Ref. [ 20] focuses on generating high-quality structural binning patterns considering the impact of process variations and proposes a new pattern-generation methodology for speed binning. Generally, the speed bin of a chip is determined by the delay of critical paths. Hence, on-chip sensors, which can measure the delay of the critical paths [ 21–26], or monitor the worst slack of critical paths [ 27–29], are adopted to infer the speed bins of the chip.

An Fmaxtest based on on-chip sensors has a lower requirement for high-end external equipment than a functional test [ 38], and it takes less time than a structural test. This type of test has gradually become popular in recent years. Due to process variations and noise, a path fails at a binning frequency with a certain statistical probability.

Due to process variations and noise, a Binning Critical Path ’s delay may exceed the bin boundary, which means the output of the path switches after the capture clock. Therefore, the capture ﬂip-ﬂop obtain obtains wrong data, making the chip drops drop to a lower bin during response analysis. The proposed Binning Checker utilizes this feature to monitor whether the timing critical path’s delay is longer than the applied clock frequency. The detailed structure of the Binning Checker is shown in Figure 2 . As the Binning Checker only includes a few standard gates, a dedicated Binning Checker can be attach attached at the end of each Binning Critical Path . The Binning Checker has two tasks: • Task 1: It locates the paths causing the Fibinning failure on silicon, where Fiis the frequency boundary between biniand its higher bin bini\u00001. • Task 2: It evaluates whether the located Binning Critical Paths can be adapted to bini\u00001 by the proposed Binning Adaptor .

As shown in Figure 2, the Binning Checker is used to monitor the output of Binning Critical Path . The clock frequency of the critical path is the binning frequency Fi. Assume the adaptable margin is S0, which is equal to the delay of BUFF 0inside the Binning Checker . To achieve Task 1, the two inputs of the XOR 0gate come from the output of the critical path Sensors 2022 ,22, 1382 4 of 18 (node Data in Figure 2) and the critical path output signal through the BUFF 0, respectively. Thus, the XOR 0gate outputs 1if the data transit from 0to1or1to0within S0.

Utilized Flash Memory To permanently place the chip into the promoted bin, it is essential to store the Adapt _ENinto non-volatile memory such as ﬂash after the binning adaptation, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. It needs to be noted that ﬂash memory is not easy to be integrated in the same die with digital electronics. Considering that most chips have to load some conﬁguration information at boot time, adaptation results (values of Adapt _EN) could be included in the conﬁguration information, which is stored in external memory, such as ﬂash. The Binning Adaptor s can read proper adaptation results from ﬂash through on-chip registers after powering on or rebooting. The ﬂash should be directly accessible by the proposed scheme.

The Limitation and Yield Optimization Rate Estimation The bin promotion may not be successful for all devices. Figure 6 shows the silicon delay distributions of all speed-paths of a device, which can be binned at Fi. In other words, all speed-paths should have a probability of locating on the right side of the binning boundary. However, some Gaussian curves almost fully locate on the right side of the binning boundary, which represents the paths with little probability of causing binning failure at Fi. Meanwhile, the other Gaussian curves have a non-negligible part locating on the left side of the binning boundary, which represents the paths causing Fi binning failure frequently. The shaded Gaussian curves in Figure 6 represent the selected Binning Critical Paths , and the \u0000S0boundary ma"}

The shaded Gaussian curves in Figure 6 represent the selected Binning Critical Paths , and the \u0000S0boundary marks the adaptability of Binning Adaptor with process variations.

However, the selected Binning Critical Paths may not cover all silicon failure paths. If the delay of an unselected path exceeds the binning boundary on silicon, such as Path 1in Figure 6, then the chip cannot be promoted to the higher bin. • Case 2: Even if all silicon failure paths are selected as Binning Critical Paths , and equipped with Binning Checker s and Adaptor s, if the actual slack of a Binning Critical Path is smaller than \u0000S0, such as Path 2in Figure 6, which means some failing paths are out of the adaptation range, then the bin promotion of the device also fails.

Application Scenarios The proposed method is to reduce the impact of process variations on chip perfor- mance through post-manufacturing adaptation. During the design phase, the designer can optimize the timing of the circuit as much as possible. For example, by inserting registers, paths with large delay can be transformed into a two or multi-stage pipeline. However, due to design and optimization constraints, there will always be some paths that have greater delay than most paths, which are critical paths.

This step can be performed during the design phase, or after being manufactured using the proposed method. However, it is know that the process variation causes a gap between design and manufacturing. Even if the designer has highly optimized the timing at the design phase, the critical path or even non-critical path after being manufactured still has the probability of falling to a lower bin. If the designer improper utilizes redundant timing of the clock distribution tree at the design phase, it may make the upper stream paths of critical paths fail at the binning boundary after being manufactured, which means there are still limitations to timing optimization at the design phase.

For example, if the delay of a critical path is 980 ps, the delay of its upper stream path is 950 ps, the adaptable margin ( S0) is 10 ps, and the target clock period is 1000 ps. The adaptable margin is the margin that the upper stream path can lend to the critical path. Considering process variations, after being manufactured, the actual delay of the critical path may be 990 ps, the delay of its upper stream path may be 990 ps, and the adaptable margin ( S0) may be 11 ps. It is possible if the critical path is built with low variation cells (LVT large cells) for small delay, and the upper stream path is built with relatively higher variation cells (HVT small cells) for low area and low power overhead.

In this case, according to the test result, no critical path adjustment is needed, and both the critical path and its upper stream path could work at the target clock period. Hence, timing adaptation based on manufacturing test results can effectively improve the performance of the chip (speed bins). In a digital circuit, optimizing and equalizing the pipeline stages is a common way to improve chip performance. Then, the upper stream path of the critical path may not have enough timing margin for adaptation. For this case, multiple Binning Adaptor s are needed, as shown in Figure 5b.

In this case, using our proposed method, which adjusts the critical path clock after being manufactured, the performance of the chip can be improved with low overhead.

The Binning Critical Path selection details and results for the implementation of this paper are shown in Section 4.3. Step 2: Binning Checker and Binning Adaptor Insertion. The Binning Checker s and Binning Adaptor s are inserted at the selected Binning Critical Paths . As discussed in Section 2, by replacing the clock buffers belonging to the original clock tree with the cells needed by the Binning Adaptor , the insertion process should not affect the already closed timing, and it requires minimum layout adjustments.

The waveforms after adaptation in Figure 8 represent the case when the adaptation status of the speciﬁc path has been written into a directly accessible ﬂash memory and applied to the path right after power up or rebooting.

Keywords Semiconductor manufacturing ·Wafer bin map ·Shape prior ·Defect pattern recognition Introduction Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process which consists of hundreds of steps.

WBMs may contain typical patterns formed by defective dies that are caused by speciﬁc manufacturing pro-cesses, and thus the detection and recognition of such patterns is of great signiﬁcance for the early detection of abnormal- ities and the analysis of root causes (Abd Al Rahman etal.,2021 ; Chien et al., 2013 ). Figure 1shows four typical examples of defect patterns. WBMs contain both systematic defects that form clusters, as well as random defects that are isolated and seen as noise to the patterns. These patterns cantrace back to assignable causes during the manufacturing pro- cess.

For example, scratches are caused by machine handling problems, while ring patterns are generated by layer-to-layermisalignment in storage node and etching problems (Kim et al.,2018 ). Conventionally, the identiﬁcation of defect patterns in WBMs relies on manual inspection with the human eye,which is time-consuming and highly subjective (Hsu et al., 2020 ). In Recent years, deep learning methods are widely applied to solve practical problems in both academia andindustry. For example, Adly et al. ( 2015 ) proposed a simpli- ﬁed subspaced regression framework for the identiﬁcation of defect patterns in WBMs. In Jin et al.

Most of the existing studies focus on the identiﬁcation of single defect patterns. Nowadays, mixed-type defect pat-terns, where multiple types of defects exist in a piece of wafer, become more common due to the evolution of the manufac- turing technology. Multiple manufacturing problems can beidentiﬁed from mixed-type patterns, with each defect pattern assigned to its corresponding root cause (Y uan & Kuo, 2008 ). The appearance of the mixed-type patterns may vary in differ-ent sizes and locations with interactions in the WBMs. For the classiﬁcation of mixed-type defect patterns in WBMs, deep learning models have been widely used due to theirgreat power in image recognition.

These models successfully recognize multiple patterns in the WBMs, but they are not able to ﬁnd the loca-tion of each speciﬁc pattern, which provides information forsubsequent analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) to determine the source of defect generation (O’Leary et al., 2020 ).

Segmentation based methods rely on deep models thatare computationally expensive, yet they fail to take the pat- tern overlap into account. Unlike a single end-to-end model, unwarpping methods represent a process of several steps,which appears more complicated and may need a greater amount of processing. Furthermore, although existing meth- ods can provide plausible result, there is no guarantee thatthe extracted patterns satisfy the desired shape constraints. Therefore, the segmentation and classiﬁcation of mixed-type pattern in WBMs is still challenging, especially when thesepatterns are overlapped or connected.

The use of STN allows the separation of overlapped and connected patterns by matching with pre-deﬁned pattern templates separately.To be speciﬁc, each pre-deﬁned shape template is deformed separately to match the pattern in the WBM to be examined. Consequently, each pattern type is extracted independentlyby the deformations of the corresponding shape template,making it possible for a pixel to be allocated to more than one pattern class, which eliminates the inﬂuence of the interac- tions between different patterns.

Finally, “ Conclusion ” section concludes this paper. Methodology In this section, we propose a novel classiﬁcation and seg-mentation model for mixed-type defect patterns in WBMs.The approach is inspired by the idea of network based regis- tration, and it takes shape priors as the additional input to the network. The segmentation is then performed by learning theoptimal deformations of the shape templates for the accurate alignment with the given image. An overview of the method is depicted in Fig. 2. The detailed description of the proposed method is presented in the following subsections.Shape templates The utilization of shape priors in segmentation networks can be in various forms, such as level sets (Cremers et al., 2006 ), statistical models (Milletari et al., 2017 ) and conditional ran- dom ﬁelds (Zheng et al., 2015 ).

The segmentation and classiﬁcation results heav- ily rely on the deformation of the shape templates, which should be carefully chosen in order to match most of thesamples. Generally, these shape priors can be obtained withmanual selection of either real or simulated patterns. The templates should be typical, clear, and preferably without noise, to improve the accuracy of deformation. Network architecture We present a model that takes images and templates as input,and outputs images warped to the templates.

The target images and shape templates are jointly sent to thenetwork as input, which extracts valuable information from the images under the guidance of the shape priors. Features should be carefully extracted to be representative in the tasksof both segmentation and classiﬁcation. We choose to use afeed-forward network architecture to perform feature extrac- tion in this stage. The residual network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016 ) has been widely applied in the ﬁeld of image seg- mentation and object detection, outperforming other deep learning models in various tasks.

Theoretically, 2Ldefect patterns are identiﬁed considering the mixture of Ltype of single defect patterns. To simplify the representation of the defecttypes, one-hot encoding is applied to describe the mixed- type defect patterns with several single patterns (Wang et al.,2020 ). For a mixed-type defect pattern, the pattern type is deﬁned as a row vector y i=[y1 i,y2 i,..., yL i], where yj i∈{0,1}indicates the occurrence of the single defect pat- tern. For example, when L=4,yi=[0,1,0,1]indicates a mixture of defect pattern type two and four in a single WBM. For multi-label classiﬁcation, two fully-connectedlayers together with the Sigmoid activation function aredeﬁned to identify the inclusion of the pattern types. The output of the network is a vector of length L, with each ele- ment c j iranging from 0 to 1. The clas"}

Therefore, the deformed shape priors are then multipliedwith the original input image Iby element-wise production, to capture the shape characteristics of the typical defect pat- tern. After the multiplication, the deformed shape priors may still match with the isolated defective points, which shouldbe avoided in the process of pattern extraction. To improve the accuracy of segmentation, the classiﬁcation results are combined to get the ﬁnal prediction. That is, if the patternexists in the WBM, the segmentation mask is retained as it is in the prediction result. Otherwise, the mask of 0 values is returned, if the pattern is not detected in the WBM.

Model evaluation For multi-label classiﬁcation, Hamming loss, mixed-type accuracy and exact match accuracy are commonly used to measure the performance (Chiu & Chen, 2021 ; Tsoumakas & Katakis, 2007 ). Hamming loss (HL) computes the propor- tion of labels that are incorrectly predicted, and smaller value gives better performance. Mixed-type accuracy (MTA) cal-culates the ratio of the size of the interaction set to the union set, measured between the actual and predicted classes. Exact match accuracy (EMA) is the percentage of WBMs that thepredicted classes exactly match the actual pattern. Highervalues of the two accuracy metrics indicate the superiority of the model.

The colors indi-cate different clusters for each of the WBM. The results of our method was shown with superposition of the extracted pat- terns following the sequence of ring, zone, scratch and centerfor better visualization. Overall, our method was capable of removing noise and insigniﬁcant shapes, which was compa- rable with the existing denoising method in Wang and Chen(2022 ). In addition, our method shows better performance compared with traditional clustering based methods, which may group connected patterns into the same clusters or sepa- rate the same pattern into many fractions instead. For the ﬁrstWBM, HC, K-means and SC cannot separate the scratches from the cluster at the wafer center due to the connectivity of the two patterns. The iWMM was able to isolate the scratchcorrectly, but it cannot automatically combine connected ring patterns at the edge.

For the second WBM, the ring and zone patterns at the edge cannot be differentiated using HC, K-means and SC, while iWMM shows good separation results; however, it divided the edge pattern into two local clusters.All the methods gave similar clustering results for the last WBM, which failed to separate scratch and zone patterns when they were really close to each other. We also compared our model with four segmentation based baseline models: the U-net (Yan et al., 2023 ), WSCN (Nag et al., 2022 ), FCN (Shelhamer et al., 2017 ) and Seg- Net (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017 ). The cross entropy loss was utilized to compute the differentce between the pre- dicted mask and the ground truth, and hyperparameters were chosen with the grid search.

When four patterns co-exist in the sameWBM, U-Net is better than our method, but the results in other classes are far less satisfactory. Figure 7further plots the mIoU values over different mixed-type pattern classes.Overall, the compared segmentation based methods show similar patterns, among which WSCN seems to provide bet- ter performance. Our method outperformed WSCN in almostall the classes, with the exception of patterns that containsZR, where results were also comparable. U-Net provided marginally higher performance in S, SZ, SZR and SZRC, but the mIoU results of other classes were signiﬁcantly worse,notably for R, C, ZC and RC. Furthermore, compared to other methods, which experienced signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations, our method produced more stable results across the variouspattern classes.

Fig. 7 The segmentation performance of our method and other segmentation models 123 Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2025) 36:319–330 329 Conclusion This paper proposes a shape prior guided defect pattern clas- siﬁcation and segmentation method in WBMs. The spatial transformer network is applied to deform the shape priors inorder to match with the patterns for extraction. The deforma-tion is conducted by estimating a transformation ﬁeld while optimizing the alignment between the template and the tar- get pattern. The registration based segmentation is able toextract single patterns from complex patterns composed of connected and overlapped patterns. Experiments show that the proposed method is effective for both classiﬁcation andseparation of mixed-type defect patterns in WBMs. The per- formance of the method is competitive with state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms, while it takes the connectivity andinteraction of the patterns into account. The proposed method could be easily extended by deﬁn- ing different representative shape priors, both real and hand-crafted ones are applicable.

The model could also beseparately deﬁned, by training a network for each pattern type individually and combining the results together. In addition, more than one templates can be determined for a pattern type,improving the capability of extracting different shapes of the same pattern. Our model could be applied in various ﬁelds to solve computer vision problems, such as object detectionand image segmentation, especially when the targets are con-nected or overlapped. In other applications, the shape priors are not restricted to shape templates, ﬂexible forms of shape priors, including probabilistic and geometric representations,could also be incorporated into the model.

Introduction The manufacturing process of in semiconductors fabrication in- volves hundreds of steps, and amounts of big data including the wafer lot history, process recipe, inline metrology measurement, equipment sensor value, defect inspection, and electrical test data are auto- matically generated and recoded. The challenge in semiconductor companies not only integrate big data from various sources into a platformordatawarehouse,but alsolackintelligentanalyticsolutions to extract useful manufacturing intelligence and support decision making regarding production planning, process control, equipment monitoring, and yield enhancement (Chien, Dou, & Fu, 2018; Dou, Chien, Kacem, & Hsu, 2018; Dou, He, & Hsu, 2018).

Wafer bin map (WBM) is outcome of circuit probe (CP) process, whichrecordsthespatialdistributionofdefectdiesonthewafer.WBM spatial patterns contain potentially useful information, in which spe- cific pattern refers to potential failure of a specific manufacturing process. Thus, analyzing spatial patterns of WBMs can provide usefulmanufacturing intelligence for engineers to track the problem in spe- cific manufacturing processes for fault detection and yield enhance- ment. In practice, most of semiconductor manufacturing companies still rely on domain knowledge and experience in which online engineers employ visual inspection and personal judgments to identify and clas- sify the patterns for the wafer bin maps in batch. However, existing judgementbyhuman-eyemaybesubjective,inconsistence,andlackof justification, while is also time consuming. Indeed, a number of studies have been done for WBM analysis and pattern recognition that can divided into two major categories: su- pervised approaches for defect classification and unsupervised ap- proaches for WBM clustering (Chien, Hsu, & Chen, 2013).

As the semiconductor industry continuously migrates for advanced nano technologies, the involved complexity of product design and manufacturing process is ex- ponentially increased. Many rare defect patterns are generated by dif- ferentpatternshape,patternsize,noisedegree,patterndensity,pattern shift, and wafer rotation. However, existing studies of WBMs focus on WBM classification and lack of capability to detect a rare pattern. In order to help engineers to recognize the rare defect patterns for root case identification as possible, the information about measuring the similarity between two WBMs are needed. As most of the industries may not be ready for migration, Industry 3.5 was proposed as hybrid strategy between the existing Industry 3.0 and to-be Industry 4.0 to empower industrial transformation (Chien, Chou, & Yu, 2016; Chien, Hong, & Guo, 2017).

In order to con- sidertwosimilarWBMswithrotation,wealsoperformCartesian-Polar coordinate transformation. The third step is to build the similarity measurement model by using modified mountain function to enhance the feature of WBMs. The value of modified mountain function is also used as a weight for similarity measurement. Then, the similarity be- tween WBMs are determined by WMHD and the weight design by modified mountain function.

Furthermore, high-volume wafer fabrication facilities typically produce thousands of wafersper week, and many of these wafers are inspected and found to be defective [1], [2], [3]. In this scenario, yield improvement is critically important, as is maintaining competitive processes and low die costsfor semiconductor wafers in a fabrication facility. During the ﬁnal process of wafer fabrication, Circuit Probe (CP) test will determine whether the corresponding die is good for packaginginto chip. Spatial patterns of testing results are WBMs that provide crucial information to identify process failures, as illustrated in Fig. 1. These patterns are formed by mark ing the defective wafers, so that manufacturing engineers may use the patterns of WBMs as clues to investigate the causes of failures resulting in yield losses. As there are many WBMs to be evaluated, the judgments in semiconductor manu-facturing thus far still rely on human labor.

As a result, the judgments may be inconsistent owing to human factors (e.g., fatigue) because of the substantial workload. In particular, not only should the defective dies be detected before package, but assignable causes should also be attributed to reduce yield and pro ﬁt loss due to scrapped wafers. During the CP test, wafers are inspected by retrieving information about defect patterns [4]. More pre- cisely, WBM patterns can provide information to help better monitor the processes and products. The WBMs , in many cases, contain charac- teristic patterns, or signatures, which provide insight into the ﬁtness of the manufacturing processes. A bin can be conceptualized as a bucket and viewed by mapping the results of these electrical tests onto a 2-Dspace. These defective patterns are usually associated with speci ﬁcm a n - ufacturing problems, and can provi de process and product engineers with important clues regarding the identi ﬁcation of causes and their so- lutions in order to improve yields [5].

Furthermore, a ma jor limitation of the fuzzy logic controller is that it requires that suitable linguistic control rules are gen- erated, as well as the knowledge and experience of human experts [9]. The simulation approach emulates the computational paradigm of a bi-ological system, subsequent ly leading to a class of arti ﬁcial neural sys- tems, termed neural networks [7], [10], [11].

From a practical perspective, the failure patterns of defec- tive wafers are increasingly complex, and possess the characteristics of bin rotation, so traditional pattern rec ognition methods cannot be adapted to address this problem. Nevertheless, we collaborated with the industry, and provide the MSVM as an alternative for achieving high-precision detection, thereby lowe ring costs and saving time.

II. T HEINVESTIGATED PROBLEM A. Problem Description The similarity search of defective wafer patterns in this work mainly addresses two problems as follows. First, the traditional pa ttern recognition or classi ﬁcation methods can not easily recognize complex patterns due to the increasing variety of defective wafers. In particular, a slight change of bins can form a to-tally different defective pattern from its original. Furthermore, as the wafer size increases, the WBMs will extend from both -a n d -axes directions, causing the defective portions to show a square growth aswell. Thus, the problem of complexity grows quadratically, since the bin maps with higher dimensions may have a great deal of variation, and further generate several more complicated wafer maps, such as inthe case of “map group movement,” which may have a high degree of similarity to the wafer maps. Consequently, owing to the high-dimen- sional bin map, it is extremely dif ﬁcult to capture the variations of each dimension. Second, the problem is that the wafer samples in stock from fab- ricators are costly and limited; besides, the types of defective waferare too numerous to collect. This problem res"}

Second, the problem is that the wafer samples in stock from fab- ricators are costly and limited; besides, the types of defective waferare too numerous to collect. This problem results in inaccurate deci- sions by such machine learning methods as ART [16], SOM [17], SVM [17], [18], etc., when using insuf ﬁcient training samples. Because more functional wafers possess more prec ise designs, it is vital to consider possible changes in small areas of the wafers. In this case, under the high-dimensional WBMs, a small ch ange may form a completely dif- ferent wafer type, making it dif ﬁcult to discover differences via tradi- tional pattern recognition techniques and classi ﬁcation methods. Thus, in order to reduce the inspection cost for a large volume of productivity,it is necessary to generate representative wafer samples with the orig- inal characteristics. Based on the above reasons, we construct morphological training samples for the SVM learning procedure in suf ﬁcient quantities ef ﬁ- Fig. 2.

B. Problem Resolving Flowchart The proposed morphology-based support vector machine (MSVM) for similarity searching will generate wafer samples with various cer- tain degrees of similarity, as compared to the objective target wafer maps . The implementation ﬂowchart of the MSVM is illustrated in Fig. 2. First, we obtain a target wafer map as the target that has gone through normalization preprocessing; then, t o directly extract more feature in- formation from the target wafer map, the MSVM tool combines with morphology to generate various wafer patterns. These simulated waferfeatures, based on morphology, provide for several types, including di- lation, erosion, opening, closing, position shift, density change and ro- tation with variations, with respect to the target wafer map, which willbe introduced in more detail"}

Next, the generated training samples contain both similar and dis- similar wafer maps; the former is a reference based on domain ex-perts, and the latter is derived through a ﬁltering process, which uses One-Class SVM to exclude possible similar samples, so as to ensure a high quality training phase in SVM. Recent research [18] has pre-sented a recognition system using SVM with a defect cluster index to efﬁciently and accurately recognize wafer defect patterns. The cluster index was designed to transform the information regarding the propor-tion of wafer defects into a numerical expression, and used them as the SVM inputs. However, when more complex and high-dimensional wafer patterns are considered, more aspects for pattern extraction forSVM must be included.

According to the ob- servation of domain experts, the patterns of WBMs may exhibit group movement, and this movement will also have high degree of similarityto the original (target) wafer map (i.e., the target wafer map); SVM is likely to have an incorrect judgm ent because it is based on the oppo- site position of two extremely different classes in the sample space, andthen separates the sample points. Ther efore, pattern shift is an essential method of sample generation in the context of using SVM in WBM. In this work, the shift direction is designed for eight positions: right, left,upper, down, upper right, lower right, upper left, and lower left. The shift size is also an adjustable parameter. In this case, the WBMs can move with a preset direction and range. Fig. 3 shows that the innerchips shift down for three steps (bins).

Rotation : Due to a lack of constant positions or directions for wafer placement during the detection process, it is essential to determine the problem with the training error caused by incorrect correspondingplacement. In this case, we use the p rinciple of polar coordinates to generate the training samples with various rotation angles, where all bins rotate around the center in a preset counterclockwise angle within0 to 360 . Fig. 5 shows that each chip rotates 90 counterclockwise around the center.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Similar to the one-class SVM, as a typical supervised learning method, the underlying theme of the SVM is to learn from the data. The difference between them is that the (Two-Class) SVMuses two parties of examples for training. Suppose that there is an input space , an output space , and a training data set ,a n d is the size of the training data. The output space deter- mines the learning type, and leads to a binary classi ﬁcation problem.

Currently, the most adaptive size is 1854-bin, since it is conve-nient for the transformation of both large and small bin-size wafer maps in the industry. As seen from Fig. 9, it is the case that a wafer with a scale of 395-bin transformed into one of 1854-bin. For the process ofscale normalization, for example, when the 395-bin is transformed into 1854-bin, the prototype of 395-bin is divided into a grid with 1854 bins, where the chips in 1854-bin are decided to be red (defective chips) onlywhen the red parts of original 395-bin occupy arbitrary area inside the chips of 1854-bin.

Result Summary In the literature, there are few methods contributing to wafer detec- tion using similarity search in the semiconductor industry. Similarity searching must consider variations of many features. This problem is very different from those more commonly related to pattern recogni- tion. In addition, signi ﬁcant CPU time would be expended if thosepattern recognition approaches such as MMA were to take all of the features into consideration. As a result, MMA can only handle fewer simple-pattern cases. Table III presents the average execution time in each step of MMA and MSVM.

Although the spatial statis- tics performed well in previous work, there are several critical issues in similarity measurement when considering complicated wafer featuressuch as rotation and shifts. For example, in terms of rotation, wafers are actually not a perfectly round shape, so some bins need to be in- serted or ignored concerning the rotat ion bins. In this case, the spatial statistic measurement cannot provide an effective similarity measure- ment because of the diversity of wafer maps.

This proposed morphology-base d SVM (MSVM) extends to more complex defect patterns (shapes). More precisely, i nstead of tradi- tional methods, the proposed MSVM has been employed to engage in similarity search through a morphological learning process, which is built in scale normalization, samples ﬁltering process, and seven types of similar samples generation approach. The experimental results showed that MSVM not only has great performance in terms of ROC curve (catching and fal se-alarm rates), bu t has faster execution time. REFERENCES [1] Q. Zhou, L.

Yield improvement has become a critical concern to guarantee high- quality products and low costs at the same time ( Dou, He, & Hsu , 2018 ). Nowadays, technique advances allow the collection of data that are seen to be of complex structure and increasingly high volume ( Li, Du, Huang, Zhao, & Deng , 2019 ; Li, Du, Wang, Lv, & Deng , 2022 ). With the help of the acquired data, it is possible to extract valuable information to monitor the system quality ( Zhang, Yan, Lee, & Shi , 2018a , 2018b ), detect anomalies ( Zhu, Huang, Shen, & Shen , 2022 ), suggest solu- tions ( Qin et al. , 2020 ) and ultimately improve process yield ( Huang, Du, Li, & Wu , 2017 ). The wafer bin map (WBM), in particular, is a two- dimensional graphic depiction of a wafer where each pixel indicates the functionality of each die. It is produced following the circuit probe (CP) yield test, which evaluates the electrical functionality of each die on the wafer following wafer fabrication.

The analysis of the patterns allows engineers to trace the problem back in history for fault diagnosis and root cause detection, which is beneficial for yield enhancement and cost reduction. In practice, the identification and comparison of the patterns are mostly conducted by engineers through visual inspection, and are heavily dependent on domain knowledge and expertise. Such human-eye based judgement may be subjective, time-consuming and lack of consistency ( Kyeong & Kim, 2018 ). To overcome the challenge of high inspection costs and yield loss associated with defective dies, many studies have been conducted for WBM analysis, and they can be divided into two categories: unsu- pervised and supervised approaches. Unsupervised learning is able to group the samples into clusters without pre-determined labels. For example, Hsu and Chien (2007 ) proposed a hybrid data mining ap- proach that integrates spatial statistics and adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks to extract patterns from WBMs. Lee, Yu, and Park (2001 ) clustered the chip locations having similar defect features th"}

Deep learning-based approaches have received an increased amount of interest recently because of their excellent capability in image processing and applicability in various fields. In Adly et al. (2015 ), General regression neural network (GRNN) was proposed for the accurate and efficient identification of defect patterns in WBMs. The most popular solution is the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is specifically developed for image data, examples of these models are seen in Hsu and Chien (2022 ), Kang and Kang (2021 ), Nakazawa and Kulkarni (2018 ). In modern wafer manufacturing systems, mixed-type defect patterns which contains two or more single pattern in the same WBM, are frequently observed because of the increasing circuits density and wafer design complexity. For mixed-type patterns, several manufactur- ing problems can be found, with each defect pattern having a related root cause ( Yuan & Kuo , 2008 ). Fig. 1 illustrates examples of the same mixed-type defect pattern consisting of ‘‘Scratch’’, ‘‘Center’’ and ‘‘Loc’’ patterns. ‘‘Scratch’’ patterns are generated by machine handling problems, ‘‘Center’’ patterns are caused by uniformity variations in the "}

In Fig. 1, both systematic defects that forms certain patterns, and random defects that are seen as noise to the patterns, are seen in the same WBM. In addition, the combination of sizes and placements of various single patterns may also vary significantly, making it more challenging to recognize mixed-type patterns. For the classification of mixed-type defect patterns in WBMs, a few deep learning based models have been proposed. Kyeong and Kim (2018 ) used a mixture of each pattern’s distinct CNN-based classification model to recognize mixed- type defect patterns. Wang, Xu, Yang, Zhang, and Li (2020 ) introduced a deformable convolutional network to extract high-quality features for mixed-type pattern recognition.

Shin, Kahng, and Kim (2022 ) suggested utilizing samples with single type patterns to train CNNs in WBMs with a Mixup-based strategy for the classification of mixed-type patterns. Existing approaches provide solutions for automatic recognition of defect patterns in both single and mixed-type scenarios. However, these classification based methods may have limitations that they cannot distinguish the similarity of different WBMs regarding a query one, resulting in the misdiagnosis when tracking in the history, if the pat- terns are not significantly similar ( Liao, Hsieh, Huang, & Chien , 2013 ). Furthermore, existing methods cannot give satisfactory results when recognizing a newly or rarely observed pattern. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness for the tracking of root causes, similarity measures between two WBMs are considered for the WBM analysis. Similarity searching makes it possible to identify root causes by tracing the process history using similarity as a criterion, which limits the scope of troubleshooting and lowers the risk of misdiagnosis ( Hsu, Chen, &Chien , 2020 ).

However, the determination of similarity measure is chal- lenging because the similarity defined by human experts is intrinsically subjective. In addition, the patterns in the each class may also vary in noise level, pattern location and wafer rotation, etc. These factors need to be carefully considered in the design of the similarity measure. Few studies have focused on WBM similarity searching. The ma- jority of the studies that examines similarity measurement of WBMs involve the training of supervised models, which may not guarantee performance when labels are unknown, as the features for similarity ranking are learned using labeled data ( Liao et al. , 2013 ; Nakazawa & Kulkarni , 2018 ). To address this issue, Wu et al. (2014 ) developed a set of novel rotation- and scale-invariant features without pre-determined pattern labels, and similar WBMs are found based on the Euclidean distance of the extracted features.

However, existing methods mainly deal with single type defect patterns, which lacks the adaptability for mixed-type patterns that appears to be complex, which includes patterns varying in different sizes and locations with interac- tions. For mixed-type patterns, however, the root causes corresponding to the isolated single patterns are independent. That is, a WBM may contain multiple patterns, with only one pattern having the same root cause with the query one.

The proposed method is based on the preliminary work in Wang and Wang (2022 ). Tensor voting ( Mordohai & Medioni , 2010 ), a perceptual grouping technique, is initially used to transform the WBMs in order to retrieve structural information. In tensor voting, information about the local structural features is propagated across the neighborhood. As a result, points that belong to the same structure will give coherent structural information, which can then be used to find salient structures ( Du, Yan, Chang, & Shi , 2022 ).

Methodology In this section, we propose a novel similarity searching approach in WBMs, which can be applied when the defect patterns appear to have mixed types with noise. To obtain structural saliency of the defects, the tensor voting algorithm is first applied to original WBMs. Based on the results of tensor voting, the noisy defects are removed to emphasize the pattern structures and improve the data quality. Then, a similarity measure is proposed to properly evaluate the similarity between WBMs with robustness to background, occlusions and complex deformations. The detailed description of the proposed method is presented in the following subsections. 2.1.

Tensor voting based feature transformation The raw WBM is a binary valued image that contains only the functional information of each die. Therefore, it is hard to infer specific patterns directly based on the original WBM data. Conventionally, in semiconductor industry, the mountain function (Yager & Filev, 1994) is used to compute the density of the surrounding pixels around a given point on an image in order to obtain the spatial distribution of the patterns (Liao et al., 2014). The mountain clustering method gives the clustering features of the defective dies, but it cannot represent different structures that make up of the WBM such as curves and regions. The tensor voting is a perceptual grouping method which aims to extract salient features from clouds of points without prior knowl- edge (Medioni, Tang, & Lee, 2000). It has shown great power to infer structural information based on good continuation and proximity under the existence of gaps and noise. Specifically, in 2-D, the tensor voting is able to distinguish curves, junctions and regions from corrupted images, which provides a chance to amplify the pattern related features in the WBMs. In the following, we present a br"}

The tensor voting proposes that the arrangement of the surrounds, rather than the individual points, determines the structural saliency. In particular, a tensor vote is cast from the voter to the vote receiver subject to proximity and continuity requirements. In Fig. 2, two points 𝐱𝑖∈R𝑑and𝐱𝑗∈R𝑑are connected by some smooth structure, the unit normal 𝐧𝑗is the voting tensor, 𝐫𝑖𝑗is a unit vector at 𝐱𝑗pointing to 𝐱𝑖, and𝐯𝑖is the normal vote received at 𝐱𝑖derived by the osculating arc between the two points.

Given that defect patterns in the WBMs mostly consist of curves (such as ‘‘Edge’’ and ‘‘Scratch’’) and regions (such as ‘‘Center’’ and ‘‘Donut’’) structures, the application of tensor voting for feature trans- formation is advantageous for the analysis of these defect patterns.

Similarity measure Based on the information obtained from tensor voting, we attempt to compare the patterns in the WBMs after noise removal. A template matching approach called the best-buddies similarity (BBS) ( Oron, Dekel, Xue, Freeman, & Avidan , 2017 ) is applied to evaluate the similarity between two WBMs. Both the structural saliency and location information of the denoised WBMs are considered for the computation of the similarity measure. BBS is inherently robust to outliers, because it only counts the pair of points that are mutual nearest neighbors, which is also known as best-buddies pairs (BBPs). In addition, BBS has the property that the maximum BBS value reaches only when the two groups of points to be compared are drawn from the same distribution, and the result decreases sharply as the distribution diverge.In the context of WBM similarity searching, BBS is defined to measure t"}

The two sets of points are denoted as 𝑃= {𝑝𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1and𝑄= {𝑝𝑖}𝑀 𝑖=1,𝑝𝑖,𝑞𝑗∈R𝑑, respectively. A pair of points is considered a BBP, if for a pair of points {𝑝𝑖∈𝑃,𝑞𝑗∈𝑄},𝑝𝑖is the nearest neighbor of 𝑞𝑗in𝑄, and𝑞𝑗is the nearest neighbor of 𝑝𝑖in𝑃. Then BBP can be formulated as an indicator function, 𝑏𝑏(𝑝𝑖,𝑞𝑗,𝑃,𝑄 ) ={ 1, 𝑁𝑁 (𝑝𝑖,𝑄) =𝑞𝑗∧𝑁𝑁(𝑞𝑗,𝑃) =𝑝𝑖 0,otherwise(11) where𝑁𝑁(𝑝𝑖,𝑄) = arg min𝑞𝑗∈𝑄𝑑(𝑝𝑖,𝑞𝑗)is the nearest point of 𝑞𝑗in𝑄, and𝑑(𝑝𝑖,𝑞𝑗)is the distance between 𝑝𝑖and𝑞𝑗.

However, the number of defective points varies in different WBMs, so here a weight is included to compare these patterns.

The greater value of 𝑊𝐵𝐵𝑆 indicates higher similarity between template 𝑃and target𝑄. Both the structural saliency and the location of defects should be taken into account for the similarity measurement of WBMs. Curves and areas can be separated by structural saliency, while the specific patterns of the defect clusters can be determined by the locations. For example, ‘‘Center’’ and ‘‘Loc’’ patterns show similar results in the ball saliency map, but the ‘‘Center’’ pattern appear much closer to the wafer center. Then the distance measure is defined as a tradeoff between structural and location information: 𝑑(𝑝𝑖,𝑞𝑗) =‖‖‖𝑝(𝑆) 𝑖−𝑞(𝑆) 𝑗‖‖‖2 2+𝜇‖‖‖𝑝(𝐿) 𝑖−𝑞(𝐿) 𝑗‖‖‖2 2, (15) where superscripts 𝑆and𝐿denote the descriptor of structural saliency and location, respectively, and 𝜇is a parameter that controls the weight of the strength between structure saliency and the location information.

Model evaluation To evaluate the similarity between two WBMs, we examine the problem of binary classification, i.e., if the WBM contains the query pattern𝑐, for the identification of mixed-type patterns. If the similarity measure is higher than a certain threshold, the WBM is predicted to include the query pattern 𝑐. The combination of actual and predicted classes has four results: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN), as shown in Fig. 4. True positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are defined as: TPR =TP TP+FN, (17) FPR=FP FP+TN.

(18) The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds, is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The precision–recall (PR) curve is additionally applied to evaluate the detection performance on imbalanced data, as the ROC curves are overly optimistic when the amount of positive examples is far less than negative ones ( Saito & Rehmsmeier , 2015 ). Specially, the pattern ‘‘Random’’ and ‘‘Near-full’’ are single-type patterns and cannot mix with others, showing classes imbalance in the task of binary classification. The precision (Pc) and Recall (Rc) defined at every threshold are: Pc=TP TP+FP, (19)Rc=TP TP+FN. (20) It should be noted that the definition of TPR and Rc is the same, where TPR=Rc in the two curves.

This similarity matching method can help engineers to iden- tify defect patterns efficiently by tracking in the history, and therefore support the diagnosis of root causes for smart productions. In this paper, we mainly examine the problem of whether the WBM consists of a particular single pattern, due to the fact that most of the examples collected in real applications consist of only single pattern types. Matching with a single pattern is also easier to consider and produces more accurate results. In addition, a mixed-type pattern can be identified by combining the thresholding results of the related single patterns and the similarity distance with the chosen single pattern, which provides useful information for pattern identification.

Using tensor voting, the structural in- formation of the defect patterns is first highlighted.

The proposed method uses an unsu- pervised approach to search for similar WBMs by measuring the similarities of three spatial features of defect patterns –shape, location, and size–which are useful for defining new defect patterns and diagnosing their causes. These three similarities are achieved using tensor voting and the mountain function for shape similarity, Euclidean distance for location similarity, and a combination of defect count and average radius for size simi- larity. The overall similarity was assessed using the weighted average of the three similarities.

The outcomes of these tests are mapped to corresponding wafer bin numbers. By utilizing these wafer bin numbers, a visualization of in- terest for defective areas is created, forming what is known as a wafer bin map (WBM) (Kyeong & Kim, 2018). The shapes or patterns of the combined chips in this WBM provide insights into process variability, equipment malfunctions, material defects, design flaws, and environ - mental factors. Therefore, accurate detection and comparison of defect patterns in WBM present an opportunity for improvement in semi- conductor manufacturing (Chen & Liu, 2000; Hsu & Chien, 2007 ).WBM analysis can be broadly categorized into two branches: su- pervised and unsupervised.

Recent studies have relied predominantly on supervised learning techniques (Gallo & Capozzi, 2020; Kahng & Kim, 2021; Lee & Kim, 2020; Park & You, 2023; Wang & Ni, 2023), which involve pre-existing knowledge of defect patterns, labeled data, and extensive training processes. However, as technology advances rapidly, semiconductor manufacturing processes evolve swiftly, leading to the emergence of new defect patterns in WBM (Kyeong & Kim, 2018; Liao et al., 2014 ). Supervised learning methods are limited to identifying only patterns that are known beforehand, posing a significant constraint in the dynamic environment of semiconductor manufacturing, where new defect patterns frequently emerge (Lee et al., 2023 ). The adoption of similarity search methods is necessary to detect new and unknown defect patterns effectively (Lee et al., 2021 ).

In recent years, several studies using similarity search techniques for WBM analysis have been conducted. Liao et al. (2014) were the first to propose an algorithm that utilizes label information to perform simi- larity searches and rank WBMs based on similarity. Subsequently, methods employing supervised learning, which require label informa - tion, were developed for similarity searching (Kong & Ni, 2022; Naka - zawa & Kulkarni, 2018; Yu et al., 2019 ).

To overcome this limitation, the use of unsupervised learning for similarity searches was proposed (Wu et al., 2015 ). Subsequent research focused on different aspects of defect patterns. For instance, Hsu et al. (2020) focused on capturing the density of defect clusters, while Lee et al. (2021) identified the locations of the defect clusters. Recently, Wang & Wang (2022) emphasized capturing the shapes of the defect clusters. However, existing research on similarity searches fails to sufficiently capture the spatial features. For instance, Hsu et al. (2020) focused on capturing the density of defect clusters, while Lee et al.

For an effective process diagnosis, it is crucial to identify the precise causes of defects and provide detailed information, such as lot or machine numbers, to better understand the defects. In this context, we believe that a method presenting three spatial aspects of defect patterns offers a higher likelihood of providing more detailed information about defects, along with defect suspicions, compared to considering only one or two aspects. Therefore, it is essential to simultaneously search for WBMs with similar defect patterns in all three aspects. However, the existing methods lack the ability to identify detailed spatial information regarding the shape, size, and location of defect patterns, thereby limiting their effectiveness in diagnosing the causes and improving the occurrence of defect patterns in semiconductor manufacturing processes. For example, during photolithography, patterns are imprinted onto the wafer surface using light (Nguyen et al., 2022), stage movement, or stepper motor errors.

These errors are often observed as linear defect patterns in WBMs. Most linear defect patterns are unique because they have different locations and sizes, and these differences result from different causes. In such cases, searching for linear defect patterns with similar locations and sizes is useful for tracking and diagnosing the causes. However, the existing methods focus on searching for linear- shaped patterns without considering their size and location. This claim is true not only for linear shapes but also for other shapes such as arcs, donuts, clusters, and rings. Chemical–mechanical planarization, a major semiconductor manufacturing process, can cause uneven slurry distri - bution, pad wear, and inconsistent pressure (Basim & Moudgil, 2002 ). These failures result in cluster-shaped patterns such as hotspots.

Moreover, it enables easy identification of new defect patterns based on these three similarities. We used tensor voting and the mountain function to measure the shape similarity, the Euclidean dis- tance of the defect center between the two WBMs for location similarity, and the variance of the number of defects, in addition to the average radius of the defect cluster for size similarity. The overall similarity was then measured using a weighted average. Each weight was measured based on the uncertainty of its weight similarity using information en- tropy.

WBM defect analysis research can be broadly divided into two main categories: one focusing on the accurate class classification of defect patterns, and the other utilizing similarity with target wafer maps to identify more clear and specific causes of defects, thereby aiding in engineering solutions. The existing studies on WBM defect analysis primarily employ supervised learning algorithms (Kim & Behdinan, 2023 ), particularly those studies on defect pattern classifi - cation aim to learn predefined defect type classes to detect them accu- rately and efficiently.

This demand has stimulated research on similarity search methods. The research on similarity comparison can be divided into supervised and unsupervised learning-based studies, with supervised learning methods using labeled data to search for WBMs similar to reference maps. Various studies have been conducted on this approach, highlighting its importance and effectiveness in identifying comparable defect patterns in WBMs. Liao et al.

Moreover, as mentioned in Section 1, they are constrained to identifying only previously known patterns, which is a significant limitation in the dynamic environment of semiconductor manufacturing, where new defect patterns emerge frequently (Lee et al., 2023 ). To overcome these limitations, several studies have been conducted that do not require label information. Wu et al.

In addition, a wafer map similarity ranking based on the Euclidean distance of the extracted features was designed to retrieve defect patterns on WBMs, similar to a given query wafer map, which can assist engineers in identifying the root causes of similar failure patterns.

Overall, there is a gap in existing research on the integration of spatial features in similarity search methodologies. The proposed method attempts to independently assess shape, location, and size before synthesizing these dimensions to establish a comprehensive similarity ranking and ensure thorough consideration of spatial characteristics.

Noise filtering The proposed method includes a two-step noise-filtering process that involves the sequential use of c-mean filtering and tensor-voting algo- rithms. This eliminates unnecessary information from the WBMs images and extracts more accurate defect patterns to help the proposed simi- larity searching process focus only on defect patterns and not on noise. In WBMs, some defective chips deviate significantly from the defect patterns; therefore, these cases are considered noise and must be removed to enhance the performance of the proposed method. The effect of noise filtering is directly related to the improvement in algorithm performance, and this two-step noise filtering process differs from that of previous studies.

The WM-811 K dataset contains 811,457 WBMs from actual semiconductor manufacturing processes (M. J. Wu et al., 2015 ). It categorizes WBMs into eight defect pattern types, as listed in Table 3. They are Center, Donut, Edge-local, Edge-Ring, Loc, Random, Scratch, and Near full of 632 different sizes. Among the entire WBM dataset, about 21.3 % are labeled, and the remaining 78.7 % are unlabeled. While previous supervised learning-based studies utilized only the labeled data (21.3 %) for accuracy comparison in classification and similarity measurement, this study conducted similarity measure - ment experiments using the entire WM-811 K dataset, as it employs rule- based unsupervised learning that does not require labeling. Section 4.1illustrates the process of computing the three similarities for P and Q selected from the WM-811 K dataset.

Similarity search using WM-811 K By substituting Q with every WBM in the WM-811 K dataset and repeating the process described in Section 4.1, the three similarities of each WBM in the WM-811 K were computed. These similarity values were then used to calculate the weights wshape, wlocation , wsize , which in turn were used to compute the overall similarity and perform the ranking.

The three weights for each defect pattern type are shown in the first row of Fig. 3. These were obtained based on the information en- tropy theory described in Section 3.4. It is noteworthy that the three weights are determined relatively evenly, which implies that the simi- larity search considers these three aspects in a balanced manner.

This means that the location aspect plays an important role in distinguishing similar patterns to search for Qs that are more similar to a given P. Let us compare two groups: one with small wlocation values and the other with large wlocation values. The center, Random, and Near-full types (first, sixth, and last columns in Fig. 3) had smaller wlocation values, whereas the Edge-local, Edge-Ring, and Scratch types (third, fourth, and seventh columns in Fig. 3) had larger wlocation values. The three defect pattern types of the first group tended to be located at similar positions on the WBM, implying that the location aspect did not play an important role in discriminating between similar patterns. By contrast, the other three defect pattern types can be located at various positions on the WBM; thus, the location aspect plays a critical role in searching for Qs that are more similar Qs to a given P.

The results showed that it took approximately 0.3 s to compare a reference WBM with a candidate WBM. Of this time, the image preprocessing phase occupied about 0.26 s, making up the ma- jority of the time consumed. It was observed that the process of calcu - lating and comparing the similarities in shape, size, and position had a relatively lower computational complexity. Moreover, it was noted that the comparison of size and location similarities required a significantly lower computational time (about 0.0008 s in total), indicating that there is no substantial difference in computation time and complexity when comparing similarities based solely on shape. 4.3.

In Fig. 4(a), when the reference pattern is Edge Loc, scratch defect patterns with similar curved shapes exhibit high shape similarity scores.

Additionally, even in the case of center defects that were not appropriately retrieved in Fig. 4(d), it can be confirmed that the proposed method correctly identified similar types of defects up to the fourth image.

Consequently, through Fig. 4, it is confirmed that the shape, location, and size similarity algorithms in the proposed methodology faithfully find candidate WBMs according to the purpose of each similarity mea- surement. This indicates that our methodology operates appropriately. However, considering each similarity comparison method indepen - dently or assigning equal weights to each similarity score to measure a composite score can retrieve similar WBMs that differ from the reference WBM. To prevent this, it is important to apply the uncertainty estima - tion and weight assignment method based on the information entropy theory proposed in the study, using the weighted average of each sim- ilarity score. 4.4.

Looking at the results in detail, in the case of the traditional similarity search method, when recommending the top 10 WBM images based on similarity scores, although images from the same defect pattern class as P were presented, they mainly depended on shape. In particular, as can be seen in Fig. 5(a), despite the Loc defect pattern located at the top left of the wafer, the existing study selected a WBM at the top right with different location and size as the most similar image. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5(a), the fourth and eighth Qs from the left have smaller defect patterns than P, showing significant differences in shape, size, and location with the reference WBM "}

On the other hand, all Qs found using the proposed method show high similarity with the reference WBM in all aspects, such as shape, form, and size.

Additionally, we incorporate the average radius of defect clusters and the variance in defect counts for size similarity. The overall similarity is calculated using a weighted average, with each weight determined based on the uncertainty of each similarity score using information entropy. By employing these methods, our proposed approach can independently evaluate shape, location, and size characteristics, automatically identify dominant fea- tures, and derive integrated overall similarity scores. The proposed method does not require predefined labels for defects or a training process, enabling swift and accurate comparison of defects even for previously unknown patterns. Moreover, it effectively detects spatial features, allowing for a more nuanced comparison within the same defect pattern class. These achievements are particularly effective for defects like Edge-Loc and Scratch, where location and size infor- mation are crucial.

Additionally, the adoption of two unique preprocessing methods to compare defect shapes, locations, and sizes may increase computational complexity. Therefore, future research should focus on developing efficient pre- processing methods, especially for handling diverse types of mixed de- fects.

This paved the way for many-core pro-cessors and highly integrated system-on-chips (SoCs). Theincreased variability in transistor parameters and workload-dependent ﬂuctuations in operating conditions have madeharnessing the full beneﬁts of scaling a challenging task [ 1]. Variations can be broadly categorized into the following classes. 1) One-time static process variations due to manufactur- ing imperfections that cause transistor and interconnectparameters to drift from their designed values. 2) Run-time dynamic variations—power supply noise and temperature ﬂuctuations—resulting shifts in operatingconditions.

Variations impact transistor length, width, threshold voltage, oxide thickness,etc., all of which directly contribute to path delay variations.As a result, a certain path may show signiﬁcant discrepancyin the delay between pre- and post-fabrication stages [ 2], [3] and the actual speed limiting paths might be masked in thesimulation phase [ 4], [5]. As a result of path delay variations, the maximum operating frequency of a chip (e.g., microprocessors, DSPs, micro-controllers, and application speciﬁed integrated circuits) or theF maxvaries from chip-to-chip and wafer-to-wafer. In order to sustain an acceptable yield rate without compromising perfor-mance, at the production test phase chips are binned accordingto the maximum functional or operating frequency.

Additionally, an expensive automated test equipment (ATE) is required that iscapable of running the test workloads at the comparativelyhigher F maxfrequency range. In [ 7], experimental data on test time for server processors were presented to corroborate thefact that a major portion of total test time is associated withspeed binning.

However, in order to apply structural delay fault testpatterns, the path under test must be testable. To make all thepaths testable by structural test patterns, extra test points may be required to be inserted which incur area overhead [ 12]. Also structural test’s correlation (i.e., direct linear correlation)to the functional-test F maxcannot be guaranteed for advanced technology nodes because of process variations [ 11], [19]. Researchers proposed the concept of built-in speed- grading [ 14] and built-in delay-binning [ 15] where the built-in self-test (BIST) hardware and on-chip programmable clock generator were used to apply BIST patterns at different fre- quencies by the chip itself, thus eliminating the need forexpensive ATE and also reducing the test time.

However,because of the pseudo-random nature of BIST patterns, thesepatterns may not excite the critical/near-critical paths [ 13]. As a result, the accuracy of this method in correlating to the chipF maxcannot be proven [ 19]. In [16] and [ 17], on-chip circuits were used to measure the propagation delay of critical paths and then the longestmeasured delay dictated the chip F max. Although direct mea- surement of critical path delays would eliminate the costlyprocedure of repeated application of the functional test at dif-ferent frequencies, the large number of possible critical pathsin modern SoC make it almost impossible to include that many path delay monitoring circuitry. Also, the preselected critical paths may not remain critical in each fabricated chip due tothe increasing levels of process variations [ 3].

The reported speed- binning accuracy ranged from 90% to 93% in [ 18] and 87% to 93% in [ 19] based on silicon data collected from chips fabricated in 55 and 28 nm technology, respectively. For chip timing data extraction, in [ 21], a systematic method to synthesize multiple design dependent RO (DDRO) circuitsusing standard cell gates is presented. Because of the design dependent aspect of the proposed RO, and the use of critical path cluster information in the design, the DDRO offers signif-icant accuracy improvement over conventional inverter-basedRO in delay estimation [ 21]. Since DDRO is a replica type monitor, it offers lower area overhead and design cost com-pared to the in-situ monitors. However, as discussed in [ 21], replica monitors such as DDRO can only capture global varia- tions; whereas in-situ monitors are better suited for capturing local variations in addition to the global variations as "}

In [ 22], an in-situ technique called SlackProbe was proposed that probes the intermediate nodes of critical paths to detect any impending timing failure within a monitoring window. SlackProbe wasdesigned to detect possible timing failures—without recordingthe actual slack value—on the critical paths for the purpose of activating remedial countermeasures, whereas the goal ofour designed slack sensor is to measure and record the timingslack of critical/near-critical paths for F maxestimation.

P ROPOSED SPEED BINNING FLOW The chip Fmaxis limited by the path delay of the most critical path. Because of process variations, the exact critical path cannot be identiﬁed at the prefabrication stage [ 5].

As a result any of the critical or near-critical paths—identiﬁed fromthe static timing analysis (STA) or statistical STA—can be thespeed-limiting most critical path for a certain chip dependingon the chip-to-chip process variations. Without loss of gener-ality, path slack, and F maxdistributions are correlated [ 8], [9]. As a result, if the impact of process variations on path slack distribution is known, using the slack’s correlation with Fmax, one would be able to predict the distribution of Fmaxwith pro- cess variations at the production test stage. In order for thisapproach to be practical, we would require a simpler methodto extract path slack in-situ from fabricated chips. Toward this goal, we have designed an all digital sensor IP which is con-nected to a capture ﬂip-ﬂop, and records the worst-case slack of all the paths that terminate at that capture ﬂip-ﬂop. The use of slack sensors eliminates the frequency sweep step associ-ated with speed binning.

To make a falling transi-tion detection sensor the M0–M6 bits are simply required to be connected to the ¯Qoutputs (instead of Q) of the ﬂip-ﬂops of the monitor unit (MU). The different modules of the sensor and their functions are brieﬂy described below. A.

To preserve the relativetiming relationship between the actual clock (CLK) and inputdata ( D_in), the clock gating cell was placed with both the incoming data ( D_in) and clock (CLK) inputs. As a result CLK_ EnandD_Enwere synchronized similarly to their non clock-gated counterparts. The clock gating mechanism also minimizes power dissipation during the sensor OFF stage by cutting the dynamic power dissipation.B. Delay Line The delay line consists of a chain of unit size buffers from the standard cell library. The buffers quantize the total slack according to the propagation delay of the used buffer. Thenumber of required buffer stages in the delay line dependson the desired slack detection range and the delay of a unitsize buffer. Use of the unit size buffer from the standardcell library ensures that the slack detection resolution is theoptimum. C.

This State signal indicates if the desired (rising or falling, depending onsensor conﬁguration) transition is occurring in the incomingdata D_in. D. Capture and Result Storage Unit The capture and result storage unit (CRSU) is constructed of storage cells connected in a scan chain. Each storage cellconsists of an OR-AND gate and a scan ﬂip-ﬂop as shownin Fig. 2. Each ﬂip-ﬂop in the scan chain samples the corre- sponding MU ﬂip-ﬂop’s output. The AND gate connected tothe scan ﬂip-ﬂop inside the storage cell makes it sticky, in thesense that if the ﬂip-ﬂop ever records a zero, it will hold on to the zero until reset or it is scan-loaded with a logic one. The State signal makes the OR gate transparent to the outputs of MU ﬂip-ﬂops only for the desired transitions. At the initial-ization stage all the scan ﬂip-ﬂops are set to logic one.

Duringthe slack evaluation phase, SEis set to zero and the ﬂip-ﬂops inside CRSU record the worst-case slack observed at the mon-itored capture ﬂip-ﬂop. The sensor data extraction process is initiated by setting SEpin to logic high which connects the ﬂip-ﬂops in a scan chain clocked by the main clock and ﬁnallythe stored slack data is extracted through the Senor _SOpin. For multiple number of sensors, their CRSU are connectedby a scan chain for data extraction. The meta-stability issuemay occur in at most one of the ﬂip-ﬂops of the MU blockif the output from the buffer of the delay line arrives late in the ﬂip-ﬂop’s setup time window. Any such meta-stability is automatically resolved in our architecture as we are using twoﬂip-ﬂops in series—forming a synchronizer circuit [ 23]—with the output of each buffer in the delay line. Since ﬂip-ﬂops in both MU and CRSU are operated by the same clock, the valuesthat were latched by MU ﬂip-ﬂops are sampled again in thenext clock cycle by the CRSU ﬂip-ﬂops.

As aresult, even if there occurs a meta-stability in the MU block,the ﬂip-ﬂops of the CRSU will practically be meta-stabilityresolved because of the high mean time between failure of asynchronizer circuit [ 23] and the designed sticky feature of the CRSU ﬂip-ﬂops.

S ENSOR INSERTION FLOW In this section, we develop a gate-netlist level and layout- aware algorithm to select path-ending capture ﬂip-ﬂops to be monitored by sensors. The sensors act as features in our machine learning tool. The candidate capture ﬂip-ﬂops for sen-sor placement should be selected based on two main criteria:1) the sensors target the critical/near-critical paths and 2) thesensors or features of the machine learning tool should be agood representative of the trend of the modeling data to incor-porate the chip-to-chip PVT variations [ 25]. Our proposed sensor insertion ﬂow along with the capture ﬂip-ﬂop selection algorithm, shown in Fig. 3, addresses these criteria. For the ﬁrst condition, it is not practical to place sensors at the end ofeach of the critical/near-critical paths, as the number of suchpaths are extensive in modern SoCs. Hence, the number of sen-sors to place are decided by the area-overhead budget. For thesecond criterion, the proposed a"}

Hence, the number of sen-sors to place are decided by the area-overhead budget. For thesecond criterion, the proposed algorithm ensures that the sen- sors cover a wide range of diverse or distinct paths and those paths are spatially distributed across the layout. Spatial distri-bution of the sensors allow monitoring PVT variation effectson the timing critical paths. The ﬂow begins with the synthe-sis of hardware from RTL to the gate-level netlist as depictedin Fig. 3. At this stage, based on the standard cell library used in synthesis and the gate-level netlist, an estimate of the layout area is obtained from the synthesis CAD tool. After that, STA is performed on the synthesized netlist, and critical/near-critical paths (considering both single and multicycle paths)are sorted in order of their respective path slacks.

A. Multinomial Logistic Regression Multinomial logistic regression is a supervised machine learning technique, where a linear combination of the observedfeatures are used to predict the class label [ 26]. In this regres- sion model the log-odds of the outcomes are modeled as alinear combination of the predictor variables. Contrary to lin-ear regression, where the dependent variable or the outcome is continuous, in logistic regression it is categorical, i.e., discrete. The training set of mtraining samples is represented in the form {(x (1),y(1)),(x(2),y(2)),...,( x(m),y(m))}. The input data sample x(i)∈RN, where Nis the total number of features. For Kpossible classes, the class labels y(i)∈ {1,2,..., K}. The weight parameters, corresponding to the class labels, are θ(1),θ(2),...,θ(K)∈RN.

Multiclass Support Vector Machine The support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer is inherently a binary classiﬁer that distinguishes between two classes [ 27]. To apply SVM technique to multiclass classiﬁcation, the mul- ticlass problem is ﬁrst reduced to multiple binary classiﬁcation problems that can be solved separately [ 28], [29]. For a multiclass classiﬁcation scenario with Knumber of classes, one-against-one or all-pairs comparison would require/parenleftbigK 2/parenrightbig or K(K−1)/2 binary classiﬁers. The/parenleftbigK 2/parenrightbig hypotheses that are generated by this process are next combined to get the ﬁnal predicted class [ 28]. To combine multiple binary SVMs for multiclass classiﬁcation problems, the error correcting outputcode (ECOC) multiclass model has been proposed to achievea very high prediction accuracy [ 28]. The ECOC model reduces the problem of classiﬁcation with three or more classes to a set of binary SVM classiﬁers by using a coding matrix M C, wher"}

For the all-pairs approach and Knumber of classes, the coding matrix MChasKrows and/parenleftbigK 2/parenrightbig columns. Each row of the coding matrix corresponds to a distinct class.

Adaptive Boosting AdaBoost is a machine learning meta-algorithm [ 32], where the training ﬂow starts with the execution of the ﬁrst classi- ﬁer supplied with equally weighted training data. Based on the accuracy of the ﬁrst classiﬁer, weights on misclassiﬁeddata are increased for the second classiﬁer. This procedure ofgiving emphasis on misclassiﬁed data is repeated until all theclassiﬁers are trained. The AdaBoost.M2 algorithm [ 32], pre- sented in Algorithm 3, takes as input the set of unique class labels Y, the training data set ( X Tr,yTr), a choice of a basic classiﬁer called WeakLearn , the number of iterations N, and outputs the ﬁnal optimized classiﬁer hﬁn.

S IMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS The ﬁrst step in extracting the path slacks for speed binning using embedded sensors, is to design the sensor IP with appro-priate slack detection range. The detection resolution is limitedby the delay of a unit buffer. The nominal resolution at typical-typical corner for our selected 28 nm standard cell library is 20 ps [ 38]. The expected resolution at 14 and 22 nm nodes are 10 and 6 ps, respectively, considering minimum size buffersat nominal conditions [ 39]. The resolution also sets the max- imum round-off error limit of slack measurement. The slackdetection range is set to 15% of the nominal clock period ofthe SoC in which the sensors would be embedded.

After deciding the number of required buffers in the delay line, the slack sensor IP was written in gate-level Verilog andsynthesized with design compiler using Synopsys 28 nm stan- dard cell library [ 38]. During creation of the layout of the sensor soft macro, the buffers were placed in the same rowadjacent to one another to ensure delay consistency amongthe buffers. The ﬂip-ﬂops inside a sensor were also placedadjacently in a row. Each sensor occupied a layout area of164μm 2and dissipated 26 μW power while activated.

A similar calibration table can beobtained for other temperatures. We assume that the chip tem-perature would be available from the typical thermal sensors used in SoCs [ 36].

Also, the transis- tor level netlist of the top 10% critical/near-critical paths— identiﬁed from post layout timing analysis—were extractedforF maxidentiﬁcation. Any of these top 10% paths can be the most critical path, deciding the Fmax. While identifying the possible critical paths, both single cycle and multicycle pathswere considered. For multicycle paths, the slacks were normal-ized according to the cycle count. Because of post-fabrication process variations, it is expected that the delays of these iden- tiﬁed critical paths will vary from chip-to-chip. To simulatethe effect of post-fabrication process variations, we performeda 300 point Monte Carlo simulation on the extracted criticalpaths as well as the sensor-path pairs using HSPICE [ 38].

From detailed SPICE sim- ulations of all of the top 10% paths of the circuit, the longest path delay was identiﬁed. After adding 10% margin with this delay as a guard-band against aging and noise, the minimumclock cycle and the F maxwas estimated for each sample. In order to quantize the continuous Fmaxvalues we chose 50 MHz as the grid size or bin width. The distribution of Fmaxin Monte Carlo samples for the two variation scenarios are shown inFig. 8. For comparatively lower process variation scenario of case 1 [Fig. 8(a)], the F maxdistribution spreads from 1100 to 1300 MHz with a std. deviation of 46 MHz. On the other hand,for comparatively higher process variation scenario of case 2[Fig. 8(b)], F maxdistribution ranges from 1100 to 1350 MHz with std. deviation of 62 MHz. Comparison of these two ﬁg-ures reveal the degree of F maxspread with the magnitude of process variations.

From a comparative analysis of the results from ﬁvedifferent machine learning techniques in Figs. 10 and 11, it isobserved that random forest and ECOC multiclass SVM offerthe best prediction accuracy. On the other hand, linear logisticregression performed poorly; indicating a weak direct linearcorrelation between sensor responses and functional F max.T h e lower accuracy of AdaBoost.M2 can be explained by the fact that this algorithm emphasizes on the hard to predict sam-ples, and as a result might suffer from over-emphasizing if asmall number of samples are included in a particular class inthe training data set. This is indeed the case as is evident intheF maxdistribution plots in Fig. 8, where only 5% and 4% samples are in the 1100 and 1300 MHz bins, respectively, for case 1 [Fig. 8(a)]. For case 2 [Fig. "}

For case 2 [Fig. 8(b)], only 5% samples are in the 1350 MHz bin. The ranking of the observed accuracyof these 5 machine learning techniques in developing a F max predictor is consistent with the ﬁndings of [ 33]. In the scenario that the chips are sold with the Fmaxlabels predicted by the trained classiﬁer, there is a chance that evenfor a classiﬁer that was trained with sufﬁcient number of training samples, 1% of the predicted chips might exhibit mispredicted F max. The worst-case misprediction is one bin faster or slower than the actual Fmax. For a faster chip binned in the slower bin, the customer will not complain. However,a slower chip shipped as a faster one may cause customerreturn. Depending on the tradeoff between beneﬁts gained—from test time reduction and tester cost savings from F max prediction—and the cost that will be incurred from dealing with the customer returns of the worst-case 1% shipped sam-ples, the chip vendor can decide if they will sell the chipswith the predicted F maxlabels "}

VII. C ONCLUSION We have proposed an innovative speed-binning ﬂow that utilizes machine learning and the path slacks extracted withon-chip sensors. A novel layout-aware and gate-netlist level sensor insertion algorithm places the sensors uniformly in the layout across the critical/near-critical capture ﬂip-ﬂops. Thesensor-extracted path slacks are used as features in modelingand training machine learning software running in the ATE.For a sufﬁcient number of training samples, the worst-casemismatch between predicted and actual F maxis one bin and occurs for 1% of the predicted samples. The proposed frame- work has the potential to eliminate the high cost associated with conventional functional test-based speed-binning ﬂows.REFER"}

Hence, due to the complexity of these processes, it is impossible to produce wafers without any defects (Jin et al., 2019 ;L i u& Chien, 2013 ). After completing the wafer fabrication processes, every wafer undergoes a testing procedure including a series of multiple electrical tests to determine whether each individ-ual chip (or die) meets its product speciﬁcations. Speciﬁcally,a probe test bench is utilized to detect the electrical character- istics of the chip dies (Cheng et al., 2021 ). Then, according to the quality level, the chip dies are marked in different col-ors on the wafer map. Typically, the captured defect patterns are divided into two types: global random defects and local systematic defects. In the global ones, defects are distributedrandomly across the wafer without any spatial arrangement, 123 3360 Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2025) 36:3359–3397 even in normal production conditions.

In contrast, in the local ones, spatial correlations are observed in speciﬁc regions of awafer, resulting in patterns such as center circles, edge rings, local zones, and scratches (Wu et al., 2014 ). Integrated circuits manufacturing requires high invest- ment, precise technology, and a complex manufacturingprocess. Thus, an analysis of the wafer map is essential to improve the yield, quality, and reliability of the IC manufac- turing process. Even so, manually annotating wafer mapswith their defect types is time-consuming and expensive, especially with large production lines (Shankar & Zhong, 2005 ). Moreover, engineers judge the defect types of wafer map based on their professional knowledge and work long hours which can be exposed to visual fatigue and raises the risk of erroneous classiﬁcation. Hence, automatic inspectionof the wafer map defect is a necessary step which can reducethe time and cost.

In addition, the spatial resolution and noise of the wafer maps signiﬁcantly affect the performance of such tech- niques. Accordingly in recent times, deep feature learningand extraction has been widely applied in the ﬁeld of wafer defect recognition (Kyeong & Kim, 2018 ; Y u et al., 2019 , 2022 ; Jin et al., 2020 ; Chen et al., 2021 , Chen et al., 2022 ;; Kang & Kang, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 , Wang et al., 2022 ;Y ue ta l . , 2021a ,b,c; Zheng et al., 2021 ; Shin et al., 2022 ; Xuen et al., 2022 ; Y oon & Kang, 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2023 ). However, employing the traditional 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) in the direct classiﬁcation of defects can easily lead to instabil- ity in the classiﬁcation results (Xu et al., 2023 ), especially with very small image resolution, like the employed WM- 811K wafer map dataset.

Thus, we go for convert- ing the 2D wafer map fault detection problem to 1D detection one to get the most salient features with the least dimension- ality. Therefore, the redundancy and the high dimensionality of features can be reduced. Nonetheless, new challenges are raised, such as how to assign suitable embedding that keptthe 2D spatial information in 1D representation, proper 1Dfeature ranking, and suitable 1DCNN classiﬁer. Accordingly, the main contributions of the proposed wafer map defect clas- siﬁcation model can be summarized as follows. (1) We have exploited the importance of encoder-decoder networks, i.e., autoencoders (AE), in two ways.

This model proves efﬁ-ciency by reconstructing the original wafer maps with a total loss of 0.0011. Second, AE is introduced in a new structure as an embedding representation step withdimensionality reduction behavior, named as sparsity- boosted autoencoder (SBAE). The resultant encoded sparse maps from SBAE guarantee more discrimina-tive features with a 50% reduction in size compared tothe original wafer maps. Despite this reduction in size, inspection accuracy of 99.48% can be obtained while working with initial wafer map resolution of 27 ×25. (2) An enhanced red deer optimization (ERD) with a new tinkering strategy is proposed. ERD is applied to 1D squeezed sinograms of the previous sparse maps. TheERD algorithm results in a ﬁnal average feature pool of ~ 15 bases, i.e., ~ 1.5% of the initial wafer map size which has resolution of 33 ×29.

Sparsity is the property of being sparse or having a lot of zero entries (Sunet al., 2022 ). In the context of machine learning, sparsity is often used to refer to the number of zero weights in a neu- ral network. An autoencoder is called sparse when its hidden layer activations are encouraged to be sparse (Ng, 2011 ). The sparsity constraint is added to the loss function of the tradi- tional convolutional autoencoder. The sparsity constraint can be based on the L 1norm of the hidden layer activations or on the KL divergence between the distribution of activations in the hidden layer and a target distribution that is sparse. For the main difference between the traditional autoencoder andthe sparse one, check Fig. 5. Algorithm 1.

All the prementioned competitors are based on deep neural networks with supportive modules to enhance the detection performance.

At the other side, at resolution 25×27, the recognition metrics of three classes degrades aggressively, i.e., “none”, “loc”, and “Edge-Loc”, while the recognition of the “center” degrades slightly. The main causebehind a degradation in recognition metrics, which affectsthe grouped performance, is that the extracted discriminative feature fails to recognize this class effectively like the other classes because of sharing similar structures. Check Fig. 15 for samples of wafers for “none”, “loc”, “Edge-Loc”, and “center”.

This means the recognition rate of the faulttype is independent of higher-resolution maps, but the fault type structure. In other words, the resolution set 39 ×37 has more complicated and indiscriminative fault types that are not efﬁciently recognizable, like the resolution set 33 ×29.

The impact of feature engineering steps In the proposed fault detection method, two main tech- niques have been used for feature engineering after the databalancing step. The ﬁrst is a sparse feature learning and encoding by the proposed SBAE, where the resultant sparse encoded feature maps are extracted from the bottleneck ofSBAE. Inducing sparse regularization in a traditional con- volutional autoencoder enhances the reconstruction process and accordingly efﬁcient sparse embedding can be gainedat the bottleneck of SBAE. In Fig. 17a comparison is made between the performance of SBAE and the traditional convolutional AE (CAE) that have the same conﬁguration excluding the sparsity regularization. As shown, without theinduced sparsity, the reconstructed wafer maps at CAE are blurry without any ﬁne details contrary to SBAE. The second feature engineering step is applying the proposed tinkeredred deer feature ranking (ERD) to 1D sinograms of the resul- tant sparse encoded features from the bottleneck of SBAE.

As shown, the worst perfor- mance belongs to the ﬁrst condition (W/O ERD, W/O SBAE), despite owning the largest 1D feature pool. The redundantinformation in this large pool limits the performance of the proposed classiﬁer 1DCNN. We can see that the most wafer maps affected by the absence of the feature engineering stepsare the set of “33 ×29”, while the least affected are the setof “30 ×34”. This means that the structure of fault types in the set 33 ×29 offer more redundant information than that of the set “30 ×34”. For the second and the third condition of applying one feature engineering step, i.e., (W/ ERD, W/OSBAE) and (W/O ERD, W/ SBAE), respectively, better per-formance than the ﬁrst condition is gained with smaller 1D feature pool. As pointed out, in (W/ ERD, W/O SBAE), considering the original features without the sparse learning by SBAE increases the number of features selected by the proposed ERD algorithm seeking the global optimum feature ranking.The set “30 ×34” has the largest feature pool but with high accuracy, while the set “33 ×29” has the smallest feature pool but with low accuracy.

The adequate performance means that the extracted features guarantees a suitable discrimination between classes while failing means that features are not discriminative enough. Finally, at thefourth condition (W/ ERD, W/ SBAE), as signiﬁed, the least 1D feature pool sizes with the best performance is achieved. The sparsity induced in SBAE allows to get more sparseﬁne details that simpliﬁes the mission of ERD to ﬁnd the global optimum with the least number of features.

For fair comparison in Tables 8and 12, we have utilized the same population size and seek the parameters that keep the most possible ﬁtting score on all employed metaheuristicalgorithms. The main cause that the proposed ERD selects a smaller number of features is generally the tendency to focus moreon exploitation than other metaheuristic algorithms, such asGA, PSO, EO, GWO, and SCA.

Figure 21introduces a visual comparison between the prementioned classiﬁer in terms of the classiﬁ- cation report. The main difference between classiﬁers thataffect the total performance is the recognition metrics of “none”, “loc”, and “edge-loc”, as the main difﬁcult fault types in recognition. In Fig. 22, the training and validation losses are indicated over epochs.

The proposed model has tar- geted three objectives. The ﬁrst is getting over the highly imbalanced dataset. The second targets obtaining more dis-criminative reduced features in 1D form instead of the 2D form of the original wafer maps.

For the third objective, a new 1DCNN modelis proposed for the 9- and 8-fault type prediction, which achieves an average accuracy of 98.1% with 180 K of train- able parameters. The proposed 1DCNN is compared to othercommon 1DCNNs, such as 1D-VGG16 (98.26%, 590 K),1D-ResNet50 (96.7%, 16 M), 1D-LeNet-5 (98%, 240 K), and 1D-Inception (97.23%, 16 K). Despite the achievements of the proposed wafer map inspection model, being a hybriddeep model still increases the computational cost of the inspection procedure. Accordingly, as a future work, we intend to work on the feature engineering steps to reduceits complexity.

INTRODUCTION Aggressive technology scaling has led to large uncertainties in device and interconnects characteristics for nano-scaled circuits [1]. Increasing variations (both inter-die and intra-die) in device parameters (channel length, gate width, oxide thickness, device threshold voltage etc.) produce large spread in the speed and leakage power consumption of integrated circuits (ICs) [1, 3]. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of operating frequency and leakage current over a large number of high-end micro-processor chips [3]. From the figure, it can be observed that a mature silicon technology like 130nm suffers from about 30 % variation in maximum allowable frequency of operation and about 5 X variation in leakage power .For newer technologies, the variations are reported to be much higher with about 20 X"}

Consequently, parametric yield of a circuit (probability to meet the desired performance or power specification) is expected to suffer considerably, unless an overly pessimistic worst-case design approach is followed. Therefore, design of high-performance circuits maintaining or enhancing yield under parameter variations has emerged as a major challenge in nano-scaled technologies [3]. In recent years, statistical analysis of timing and power has been extensively explored [2, 5, 8]. Several parametric yield models have been proposed to consider impact of different sources of variations on circuit delay and power [5, 6]. At the same time, multiple efforts have been made to develop statistical design methodology that either ensures or enhances parametric yield (e.g. with respect to delay or power) under specific design constraint (e.g. on area or power) [6, 10, 13]. Profitability of a design is conventionally equated with yield [1, 3]."}

Profitability of a design is conventionally equated with yield [1, 3]. However, large spread in the frequency distribution due to increasing uncertainties has led to the concept of speed-binning to improve the design profit [4]. Presently, speed-binning is widely used during manufacturing test to qualitatively sort the working (i.e. free from manufacturing defects) ICs based on their highest permissible frequency of operation. During the speed-binning process, functional or structural tests are run at multiple frequencies and parts are binned according to the highest speed test they pass. Working ICs are then priced based on their respective frequency bins [4]. Since high-frequency ICs correspond to higher price points, maintaining yield at a target circuit delay (i.e. frequency) under statistical delay distribution does not ensure high profit. Here, profit refers to the cumulative sum of price-weighted yield of the ICs across all frequency bins. Hence, there is a need to develop design methodology that can either maintain or improve the design profit (i"}

However, they did not consider the impact of design choices or delay distribution change on the profit function.To the best of our knowledge, there is no design technique addressing optimization of design profit (instead of parametric yield at a fixed target delay), considering frequency bins and product price profile. In particular, this paper makes the following contributions: • A weighted yield model to represent profit that considers price of ICs running at different frequencies and satisfying specific power dissipation requirement. • A statistical design methodology to improve profitability of a design using a sensitivity-based low-complexity gate sizing under both delay and power bounds. • An algorithm to determine optimal bin boundaries for a design to maximize profit for a given price profile and design spe"}

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION In this section, we describe a parametric yield model of a design based on a target delay and leakage power constraint. 2.1 Modeling Yield with respect to a Target Delay Under parameter variations, circuit delay is the maximum of all path delays in the circuit [1]. The overall circuit delay, Tckt thus follows a distribution and can be modeled as a random variable with mean µ and standard deviation (STD) σ (i.e. Tckt ~N(µ,σ)) [1]. Hence, for a given target delay, the circuit will have a certain Figure 1: Leakage and frequency variations in 130nm technology ( source: Intel ) * The work is sponsored in part by Marco Gigascale Systems Research Center (GSRC) and Semiconductor Research Corp.~1000 samples 30% 5X 0.91.0 1.11.21.31.4 1 2 34 Normalized Leakage (Isb) Normalized Frequency 5"}

The yield loss occurs due to the fact that devices with lower V t (and/or lower channel length) suffer from an exponential increase in sub-threshold leakage. Therefore, there exists a strong correlation among the maximum operating frequency and leakage power of a system. In [5], authors show that when both power and performance constraints are considered, maximum yield loss occurs in the highest frequency bin, while negligible yield loss occurs in other frequency bins. Hence, we can effectively use a minimum delay T leakage "}

Hence, we can effectively use a minimum delay T leakage (or maximum operating frequency) value as a bound on the leakage power dissipation of the design. Mathematically, when Tleakage bound is used together with TD bound in (1), effective yield of a design can be given by: 2.2 Motivation Fig. 2 shows two possible circuit delay distributions (Gaussian) with the corresponding three frequency bin boundaries for a small test circuit. In this figure, Yield optimized distribution corresponds to a design obtained by optimizing for certain yield constraint at a target delay, T D. The other distribution (Profit optimized ) corresponds to a design where the distribution is changed (by properly sizing the netlist) to improve profit with respect to an exponential price profile (i.e. price point of ICs have exponential dependence on their operating frequency). Fig 2(a) shows that although both distributions meet the yield constraint at T D, the process of improving profit deterministically changes the distribution (µ increases, while σ decreases) in a w"}

Fig 2(a) shows that although both distributions meet the yield constraint at T D, the process of improving profit deterministically changes the distribution (µ increases, while σ decreases) in a way that increases the profit with respect to the given price-profile. In this case, yield loss suffered by profit-optimized design in the highest frequency bin, is easily amortized by significant gain in yields at the other two lower frequency bins. In Fig. 2(b), interestingly, yield degrades due to increase in σ though profit increases due to adequate increase in the number of highest frequency ICs (that more than offsets yield loss at the two lower frequency bins). Thus, instead of modeling and optimizing yield at a target delay, it is important to consider modeling of profit and to explore design space to optimize profit for high performance systems, which employ frequency binning. 3.

We observe that for both products, price of the highest frequency part is about three times higher than that of the lowest frequency parts. Hence, to capture the quality of different chips in the design objective function, we model design profit as a price-weighted cumulative sum of yields at different frequency bins. Thus, considering N frequency bins, the profit-aware design yield can be expressed as: where, weighing parameter w i = C (T i) is the price of a chip in the ith frequency bin. It can be noted that the weighted yield YP directly represents the profitability of the design. Fig. 3(b) shows delay distribution vs. exponential product price profile with three frequency bins (i.e. N = 3) for an ISCAS85 benchmark circuit (c499) realized in 70nm BPTM technology [9].

Since all the ICs in a particular frequency bin are sold at the same price, product price profile becomes a stair-case function of delay (or frequency) irrespective of the nature of the price function (Fig. 3(b)). As different circuits have different delay distribution parameters (µ, σ), for a given circuit, we choose price weights ( w i) in such a way that the ratio of the prices at the highest and lowest frequencies is constant for all circuits.

It was shown in [8] that, using this technique, the effect of both inter-die and intra-die variations can be taken into account. The simulation results on several ISCAS85 benchmarks show average error of 0.21% and 1.07% compared to the Monte-Carlo analysis for mean and standard deviation of delay, respectively. Gate delays are modeled with 70nm BPTM [9] parameters using analytical expression as in Sakurai et al. [11]. For simplicity, we ignore interconnect delays and assume a constant capacitive load for each net.

PROFIT-AWARE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION Using our profit-aware yield model presented in section 3.1, we propose a statistical design flow for profit optimization under an area constraint. 4.1 Yield Optimization using Gate Sizing Gate sizing is conventionally used in different circuit synthesis tools for area/power optimizations while meeting the desired timing constraint, or for minimizing the maximum delay under constraint on area/power [6, 7, 10, 13]. Mathematically, gate sizing problem for achieving mean delay A 0with minimum active area can be formulated as [7]: where, Ui,Li, are the bounds of maximum and minimum gate size, respectively, the value of A0 depends upon the target yield (YT), target delay T D, and ( µ, σ) of the delay distribution.

Starting from the minimum-sized netlist, we iteratively use the Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) based sizing algorithm [7] in conjunction with the statistical timing analysis to achieve the yield target with minimum area. In the m th iteration mean target delay is set to µm and at the next iteration we update the target delay by small steps toµm+1 as: where, σm+1 is the STD of the circuit delay after sizing in the next iteration, σm is STD of circuit delay with current sizes and k < 1 is a constant. The solution in [7] provides a globally optimal solution for the problem of area minimization under a static delay constraint. We have observed that with up/down sizing of a logic gate, the mean and standard deviation of the circuit delay shift in the same direction. Based on this observation, we obtain a yield optimized initial design with the minimum area. 4.2 Profit-Aware Gate Sizing In this section, we propose a sensitivity-based profit-aware gate sizing methodology for the optimization problem proposed in (6).

Using the proposed method, we obtain up to 26 % profit improvement (for c3540). On average, we observe profit improvements of 10.4% for the linear, 9.9% for the quadratic, and 14.2% for the exponential price profile at iso-area (Table I). Smaller slope of quadratic price function than the linear one (Fig 3(c)) for lower frequency bins is responsible for smaller profit improvement under quadratic price profile over linear one, considering equal yield bin boundaries. However, profit improvement for a particular price profile varies widely across the benchmarks and it largely depends on the design specifications as well as on the circuit topology (Table I). Profit improvement at the iso-area comes from the proper distribution of the right amount of yield in the right frequency bin (depending on the price profile).

Figure 6(b) shows profit improvements of the various benchmarks as the number of frequency bins is varied under an exponential price profile. Note that we have not considered the smaller benchmarks (i.e. c74 series) in this plot because they have small delay spread (Table I). The trend of increasing profit improvement with number of bins can be attributed to the fact that with fine-grained frequency binning, the high frequency bin prices (and the average bin price) increase considerably under a given price profile. We have obtained three sets of average profit improvement results for three different target yields ( Y T), while keeping other design specifications ( Tleakage ,TD,N) unchanged (Fig. 7(a)). We observe that profit improvement decreases with the increase in YT (Fig. 7(a)). This is due to the fact that with low initial yield, design profit is usually low for the specific price profile, thus has good scope of improvement.

The complexity of the SSTA is O(m) [7], where m is the maximum number of gates in any level in the levelized netlist of the given circuit. It is shown that even for a very large circuit this number grows very slowly [7]. The complexity of a LR sizing run isO(n a),w h e r e n is the number of gates in the circuit and a≈1.7 [8]. Moreover, since after the 1st iteration of up/down sizing, the subsequent sizing steps start with a reduced set of gates, the effective runtime of the subsequent up/down sizing iteration reduces. Hence, the over-all complexity of the design flow is dominated by the runtime complexity of the LR-based sizing (section 4."}

Basic steps of the design flow are similar to that shown in Fig. 4, except that now we use optimal bin placement routine for profit computation during sensitivity analysis in each up/down sizing routine (step 2, Fig. 5). This means that after obtaining µ andσ corresponding to sizing of a logic gate we perform optimal bin placement to compute the profit sensitivity of the gate. This method when employed to different ISCAS85 benchmarks shows up to 36% profit improvement with three frequency bins (Table II), considering a leakage bound of µ - 2.5* σ for an 90% yield-optimized design at equal area.

We observe that using integrated approach up to 10.1% (c3540) more improvement in profit over fixed bin boundaries can be achieved for exponential price profile. Note that profit improvements do not change much with optimal bin-placement for a linear price profile, since linear price profile has the smallest bin price ratio (i.e. R Lin<R Quad<R Expo). However, the integrated approach shows significant average profit improvement compared to fixed bin boundary results for both quadratic (from 10% to 16.7%) and exponential price profiles (from 14.1% to 18.8%) for a set of ISCAS85 benchmarks (Table I, and II).

Note that the runtime of the simultaneous sizing and optimal bin placement algorithm is almost indistinguishable from the runtime of profit optimization with fixed bin boundaries (Table I). This is because optimal bin placement routine has negligible impact on overall runtime, which is dominated by the number of SSTA runs. It is worth noting that although our delay models follow Gaussian (normal) distribution, the proposed methods can be easily extended to a recently-proposed non-normal delay distribution [12], which is reported to have higher accuracy in representing delay variations. With non-normal distribution, the steps on making sizing decision using profit sensitivity do not change.

CONCLUSIONS We have proposed a profit-aware yield model and a statistical design methodology to optimize design profit for a given price profile under an area constraint. The methodology can be applied to any price profile and any delay distribution models (normal/non-normal). We have demonstrated that optimal bin- boundary determination can be used to increase the design profit. Experimental results on ISCAS85 benchmarks show that the proposed profit-aware design flow that incorporates information on price profile and frequency binning during the design phase can be very effective to improve design profit under parameter variations.

In the system, two darkfield angles of incidence (oblique and normal) and two darkfield collectors (wide and narrow), in addition to a brightfield subsystem (differential interference contrast) comprise the data channels for collecting surface defect information [15] . As illustrated in F igure 1, there are several defect characteristics such as the size information of the darkfield wide (DW) and darkfield narrow (DN) channels, size information of the normal DW and DN channels, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and positions of the oblique and normal light incidences.

The intensity of the light scattered by an LLS depends on the refractive index , shape , and size of the LLS. An equivalent size expressed as umLSE or nmLSE is assigned to the LLSs by cali brating the SSIS with p olystyrene latex spheres of different diameters, deposited on a reference silicon wafer surface [18 –20]. The acronym “LSE” (latex sphere equivalent or light scattering equivalent) [21] added to the length unit indicates that the size reported by the SSIS is a metric for the light scattering cross section of the LLS and not for the true geometrical size.

In contrast to other studies on surface defect cl assification [9,26] , we defined two areas with COP - one was the disk- shaped center area (within the 0 - 50 mm radius) and the other wa s the ring -shaped ed ge area (within the 105 - 145 mm radius) . The defects in these areas are thus classif ied as LPDN based on the distribution of the crystal grown- in defects . In contrast, the PID and SFP are captured as LPD in the exclusion area of the DOI. In this experiment, limited LPD were observed based on the detection limit (DL) of 0.022 µmLSE. Fig. 8 Defect classification using RBB for the signature COP single crystal silicon wafer.

Regardless of the source of information (process data,alarm data, etc.), they rely on the complete information from the production line (Melhem et al., 2017; Jebrilet al., 2022). However, the complete process informationis seldomly available. These methods are thus impracticalfor manufacturing settings where performance, sustain-ability and detection of errors at earliest occurrence areof utmost importance (Wang et al., 2022b). As a viablealternative, we start by training separate PQP models onthe data accumulated during the initial production stage(see Fig. 1). Once the production starts, i.e., as soon as data from any (new) stages of production is available,the test results from all of the test units (TUs) in themanufacturing process are predicted using these initiallytrained PQP models.

With the continuous monitoring of production lines, it is now possible to detect quality deviations at their earliest occurrence and reduce the scrap productionrate. This paper studies the sustainability in context of a partially monitored multistagesemiconductor production line with multiple test units. Our goal is to provide a foundationfor interpretable and reliable Product Quality Prediction (PQP) in industrial use cases withnoisy quality check results and missing process information.

Toimprove the results even further, we analyze different calibration methods both for base learnersand the SM. Our final model leads to a 19 .49% reduction in the binary estimated calibration error compared to the conventional models, and thus allows for increased PQP reliability.

Overview of our PQP approachaccurate estimation of the product quality measured at the last TU. As our PQP models are trained for differentstages of the production, we do not have to wait for theprocesses to finish to make a reliable and accurate PQP. Additionally, there are sources of uncertainties in the semiconductor production lines which need to be takeninto account for achieving reliable estimations. Calibrat-ing probability estimations of the trained classifiers iscommonly used to mitigate this issue in safety-criticalsystems (Vaicenavicius et al., 2019). To the best of ourknowledge, calibrated probability estimations for PQP inthe context of the industrial manufacturing has not beenstudied. We refer to them as the Production Success Prob- ability (PSP) in this particular setting for clarity. To demonstrate the utility of PSP, we study an operatingproduction line as a use case.

Consequently, the results of the TUspreceding the final TU give us only blurred information,and therefore represent a source of uncertainty. The rawmaterials coming from different vendors also impact thequality, and are another source of uncertainty. This allmakes it hard for the process engineer to make decisionsabout the final product quality. To help reduce the uncertainties and improve the decision making, we propose to stack multiple PQP models anduse their PSPs to predict the output of the final TU.We use model stacking (Dong et al., 2020) via logisticregression (LR) at the heart of our method, which givesus interpretability and also a boost in reliability withoutsacrificing the accuracy of the final PQP model. Using thePSP values for the stacked model (SM) also makes ourapproach demonstratively more data-efficient and evadesmuch of the unwanted bias compared to the conventionalcalibration methods, which need separate datasets forcalibration to reach a comparable level of reliability andaccuracy.

The high accuracy of our approach as well as its abilityto operate on incomplete data and handle uncertaintiesmake it possible to use cost-effective PQP models inthe industry. While the method is demonstrated on asemiconductor production line, it is easily generalizableto other fields of manufacturing as well. 2.

The fail-pass criteria for intermediate quality tests are not fixed and are improved as more products are produced.However, the final TU is a fixed criteria which ensures therequired specifications of the semiconductor are met whenoffered to the customers. Moreover, some processes whichimpact the final product quality are not monitored, seeFig. 2. Given the high uncertainty induced by the unmon-itored processes, a probability value showing the chancesof producing a successful product is far more practicalthan a simple binary output of the PQP (Vaicenaviciuset al., 2019). By focusing on the probability values, wecan infer the confidence of the classifier for predictingthe final product quality given the currently availableprocess information. Additionally, when trained and cali-brated correctly, these well-adjusted probability values willalso increase the accuracy of the predictions.

The first family leveragesknowledge-based systems and the second family encom-passes data-driven approaches. Data-driven approachesneed only enough data and dispense of the domain knowl-edge, thus tend to be faster to develop and less error-prone.Mdet al. provide a thorough analysis of both families (Md et al., 2022). Our work follows the data-driven approachfor its benefits. Given the limited quality and quantity of the available process and TU data from production lines, data-drivenPQP can be challenging. In particular, the following issueshave to be addressed according to the literature from boththe data-driven PQP and process monitoring communities.

Consequently,PQP system must inherently deal with unbalanced data,either with under/oversampling, sample weighting, orother problem-specific solutions (Kov´ acs, 2019).

PROPOSED METHOD 5.1 Data preparation The process information along with the test results from different TUs in the production line, are stored separatelyin different tables of a database. As it can be seen in Fig. 2,many processes are revisited so that different subprocessescan be carried out on the currently produced batch. Thus,for generating input/output data for model training, thefollowing steps have to be completed.

Platt calibration: This method tries to calibrate a model by passing its posterior probabilities through a sigmoid function by minimizing the following cost function viagradient descent for a given set ( f(x i),yi) A, B argmin{−/summationdisplay iyilog(pi)+( 1 −yi)log(1−pi)} (2) where pi=1 1+exp(Af(xi)+B )(3) Binary estimated calibration error (Binary-ECE): In this paper, we have used the Binary-ECE as the performancemeasure for model calibration: Binary ECE =M/summationdisplay m=1|Bm| N|¯y(Bm)−¯s(Bm)| (4) where Mdenotes the number of bins in the reliability diagram, Nis the number of data points, Bmrepresents the number of data points in each bin, and lastly ¯ y(Bm) and ¯s(Bm) represent the proportion of positives and the average probability respectively. 5.

PROPOSED METHOD 5.1 Data preparation The process information along with the test results from different TUs in the production line, are stored separatelyin different tables of a database. As it can be seen in Fig. 2,many processes are revisited so that different subprocessescan be carried out on the currently produced batch. Thus,for generating input/output data for model training, thefollowing steps have to be completed. (1)Separating subprocess data: Based on factors such as part name, recipe name, etc., the data from a process table is divided into different subprocessdatasets. (2)Cleaning and annotating the subprocess data:Given any arbitrary product, it is possible to findall the subprocess and, if available, test results usingthe product’s ID. However, due to data storage, testand sensor reading errors, in some cases there will bemissing information which has to be handle when theproduct quality model is deployed.

(3)Subprocess data preprocessing: Features which are categorical, e.g., program name, recipe name, nuzzle ID, etc., need to be encoded so that they can be used in input vector. In addition, the encoders mustbe stored so that they can be used in real-time asthe production is in progress. Moreover, time stampsand delta time also need to be converted to integeror float values. 5.2 Model training In this industrial project, for each stage of processes, separate models for predicting the test results for all Fig. 3.

Furthermore, given the additional challenges of unmonitored processes and the significantreduction of the number of available samples for training,from 2267 samples to only 756 samples, the developmentof the PQP models used for predicting the results from thelast TU, depicted as green blocks in Fig. 1, are discussedextensively in subsections 5.4 and 5.5 of this paper.

The potential changesin the production, e.g., recipe changes, and also the need for a model suitably trained for a given manufacturingsetting, raises the need for a generalizable solution whichis perfectly tailored to the production line settings. There-fore, the hyperparameters of the base learners are acquiredusing grid search.

Moreover, to keep the ratio of the positive and negativeclasses almost constant during training and testing andalso to avoid optimistic accuracy estimates, while splittingthe available data from the production line, the methodused for splitting the data is stratified. In addition, giventhe fact that the number of labeled samples in a productionline is normally limited, in the proposed method, k-foldcross validation with is used to further increase the gener-alization power of the trained base learner. The balancedaccuracy of the trained base learners is depicted in Fig. 3.The numbers next to each plotted point denote the numberof features used in the predictor.

Furthermore, the accumulated infor-mation from stages three and four does not significantlyincrease the accuracy of the first PQP model. The secondPQP model on the other hand shows a slight improvementin accuracy as more information is available from the pro-duction line compared to its accuracy when only trainedwith the data from the first stage. In addition, the resultsdepicted in Fig. 3 clearly demonstrate the importance ofaccumulated stage data on the accuracy of predicting thefinal TU’s output. Starting from the third stage, as morefeatures are exposed to the base learners, the accuracy ofthe predictions is increased. This step-wise model trainingprovides insight to the improved accuracy given the cost(number of features) while accumulating stage informationwhich facilitates cost-effective PQP model developmentfor multistage semiconductor production.

Despite the highaccuracy of the base learners (outperforming the similarwork with the balanced accuracy of 71 .15% and 64.56% in Melhem et al. (2017) and Tin et al. (2022) respectively),no assumption or prior knowledge from the productionline is imposed on the training algorithm. In addition, theinput vector to base learners in each step is also differentwhich further promotes decorrelated bagging (James et al.(2013)). 5.4 Ensemble model We tested several data fusion and model stacking strate- gies. The domain knowledge from the production linesuggested that by fusing the first and second TU resultsin the input vector of the PQP model for the final TU, theaccuracy should potentially increase; however, the resultsof the training rejected this hypothesis. For inspectingthis issue, the Pearson correlation (Cohen et al. (2009))between the TUs’ results are calculated and a maximumcorrelation value of 0. 091 between the first TU and Final TU is acquired. This denotes the fact that, given theinformation from an arbitrary TU, it is not possible to inferanything substantial for the other TUs in the productionline. This issue can be blamed o"}

This denotes the fact that, given theinformation from an arbitrary TU, it is not possible to inferanything substantial for the other TUs in the productionline. This issue can be blamed on the fact that these TUsinspect different key performance aspects of the producedsemiconductors and thus their values are not correlated.Similarly, concatenating the predictions from the baselearners for the different TUs to the input vector did notincrease the accuracy of the ensemble model either. As the last attempt, unlike conventional stacking ap- proaches found in the related work, in this paper we use thepredicted PSP of the last three base learners for predictingthe results of the final TU, and map the generated vectorfrom these PQP model to the final TU result. By employ-ing the predicted PSP values from the PQP models, it ispossible to prevent the potential information loss due tothe quantization of the output to two possible outputs.This idea originates from knowledge distillation, wherein the vanilla knowledge distillation case, the logits of alarge deep model as the teacher are used to train a smallernetwork (Wang et al., 2022a).

In modern manufacturing processes, the automatic WBM defect pattern classiﬁcation is critical for yield improve- ment. Although it is difﬁcult to collect sufﬁcient labels while alot of unlabeled data is given, most existing studies have mainlyused only labeled WBM data. Moreover, the unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) WBMs are inevitably collected. It degradesthe performance of semi-supervised models. To this end, wepropose a method for safe wafer bin map classiﬁcation with self-supervised contrastive learning (SWaCo) to effectively exploit theunlabeled data with OOD.

However, this made the production process difﬁcult, andeven a slight error could cause severe inline defects, eventually causing circuit failures and reducing overall yield [2]. For quality management and evaluation of wafers, manu- facturing companies perform various inspections. After wafer fabrication before the packaging process, some of the wafers are randomly sampled. Then various types of electrical testsare performed to evaluate whether each IC chip meets the product speciﬁcations. An electrical die sorting (EDS) test is one of the widely used test methods, which inspects the elec-trical characteristics of each die of a wafer to check whether it is operating correctly. The EDS test results can be expressed as a wafer bin map (WBM). WBM portraits each die as zero if it passed the test and one if it failed. WBM can be regarded as a one-channel and "}

The EDS test results can be expressed as a wafer bin map (WBM). WBM portraits each die as zero if it passed the test and one if it failed. WBM can be regarded as a one-channel and two-dimensional image con-taining information about the size of a wafer, the position of dies, and the inspection results. Defective dies sometimes form a local pattern distinct from global random noises that appearover a wafer. Identifying the spatial and local defective pat- terns is highly important in the ﬁeld because they are usually caused by corresponding processes [3]. A local defect pattern indicates that some systematic errors exist. Therefore, classi- fying WBM defect patterns can provide hints on which parts of the current operating processes have problems based ondomain knowledge. It helps experienced process engineers to take appropriate maintenance in time. Conventionally, semiconductor process engineers manually look at WBM images and classify defective patterns directly.

Furthermore, the defect patterns have also become more diverse, and there are cases where it is even hard to classify into a speciﬁc category. Therefore, it is time-consuming andinconsistent for engineers to determine defect patterns man- ually. Many data-driven studies based on statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning have been proposed toaddress these issues that occur in manual approaches [4],[5], [6],[7]. In particular, many recent studies have been built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leverage and analyzethe graphical characteristics of WBM as images [8],[9],[10], [11],[12]. However, most studies assume a fully-supervised problem in which all WBMs have properly assigned classes.

It is essential to consider the class distribution mismatch for WBM classiﬁcation for prac- tical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted yet. In this paper, we propose a safe wafer bin map clas- siﬁcation with self-supervised contrastive learning (SWaCo) using proper data augmentations to solve the class distribu- tion mismatch problem. We hypothesize that self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) can provide proper initial networkparameters for downstream WBM classiﬁcation tasks by uti- lizing a large amount of unlabeled data with OOD. Unlike SSL methods, SWaCo does not assume identical distributions anddoes not use supervised classiﬁcation loss in the pre-training stage. It leads the model to avoid the negative effect of the mismatch class included in the unlabeled data.

The proposed loss function allows pre-training by mapping the ID samples with the same defective pattern class together while separating themfrom the OOD samples.

Data To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the public WBM dataset, WM- 811K [39]. A total of 811,457 samples are obtained from real-world wafer fabrication processes. As demonstrated inTable I, only a subset of 172,950 samples has the correspond- ing class information, while the rest of 638,507 samples are unlabeled. We divided the labeled subset into ID and OOD subsets to examine the performance of the proposed method in the class distribution mismatch scenario. Note that we consid-ered the frequency of each defect pattern to deﬁne the subsets. Although it is necessary to classify all defect patterns in prac- tice, collecting labels becomes challenging for rarer defectpatterns.

Although the proposed method achieved good results, sev- eral interesting research directions exist. First, we can consider the class imbalance problem. As observed from the WM-811K dataset, the frequency of defect patterns occurring in the semi- conductor industry is highly imbalanced. It is well known that the classiﬁcation performance for a minority class is relativelylow in an imbalanced classiﬁcation problem. In product quality control, the minority defective patterns should be effectively detected. It is worth developing a method to explicitly reﬂectthe class imbalance problem in the pre-training step of SSCL. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to a multi- label classiﬁcation model for classifying mixed-type defectpatterns. Because of dense circuits and complex wafer design, mixed-type defect patterns are easily observed in recently pro- duced wafers. Because one WBM has several types of classinformation, it is necessary to design a new strategy to select the additional positive examples for the proposed loss function in the pre-training step.

Produc- tion testing of devices targeted towards such applications callsfor a test vector set that is tailored to maximize the coverage of faults that lead to functionally malignant errors while minimizing the coverage of faults that produce functionally benign errors. Given a partitioning of the fault set as benign and malignant, and a complete test vector set that covers all faults, in this paper ,we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to ﬁnd an optimal test vector set that ensures 100% coverage of malignant faults and minimizes coverage of benign faults.

We alsopropose a test strategy based on selectively masking appropriate outputs of the circuit to partition the circuits at production test into three bins - malignant, benign, and fault-free. As a casestudy, we demonstrate the proposed ILP based test optimization and functional binning on three adder circuits: 16-bit ripple carry adder , 16-bit carry lookahead adder , and 16-bit carry selectadder . We ﬁnd that the proposed ILP based optimization gives a reduction of about 90% in fault coverage of benign faults while ensuring 100% coverage of malignant faults. This typicallytranslates to an (early manufacturing) yield improvement of over 20% over what would have been the yield if both malignant and benign faults are targeted without distinction by the test vectorset.

This stalling in frequency has promptedmicroprocessor industry to shift to an alternative computing paradigm such as parallel computing, where individual com-puters perform at a slower rate, but manage to accomplish functional tasks concurrently to be counted as an individual computer operating at a much faster rate (being roughly equal to number of parallel processors ×operating frequency of individual processor). Another possible route to mitigate the increase in power density with successive generations of a microprocessor chip,without stalling frequency scaling, is to downscale the supplyvoltage.

As a case study, we demonstrate error resilient testing of 16-bit ripple carry adder. We begin by generating all possible faults and then classifying theminto two heaps: 1) benign faults - those that cause no error or an acceptable amount of error, and 2) malignant faults - those faults that cause a signiﬁcant departure from acceptablebehavior. The metric used for classifying faults into these twoheaps is a simple measure – error magnitude, which is thedifference between actual value (with the fault present) andthe ideal value. Once the two heaps of faults are generated, we use an automatic test pattern generation (A TPG) tool togenerate tests for all malignant faults in the circuit.

Clearly, with such a deﬁnition for “error signiﬁcance,” the union ofmalignant and benign faults encompasses the entire fault set(with any redundant faults counted as benign faults). In thesubsequent sections, we describe fault simulation to ﬁnd errorsigniﬁcance of each single stuck at fault to categorize theminto two groups, namely benign faults and malignant faults.

S ELECTIVE OUTPUT MASKING FOR FUNCTIONAL BINNING The previous section dealt with optimizing the test set for targeting malignant faults while minimizing the test coverage for benign faults. However, for applications where circuitsare to be binned, for instance into three categories, namely- malignant, benign, and fault-free, one can can propagate faults to speciﬁc outputs and selectively observe them, whileignoring the remaining outputs of the circuit. This can be explained as follows. For an adder, a circuit having a malignantfault, by deﬁnition, has at least one input vector whose output Fig. 3.

So, beginning the test ﬂow by testing the circuit for all malignant faults by using vectors that propagate the fault only to the more signiﬁcant bit positions (MSB)(precisely bit positions that have value ≥𝜅) will weed out any circuits that have malignant faults, and can be binned into malignant category. Note that since all tests are propagate faults only to the more signiﬁcant bits, the lower signiﬁcantbits (LSB) (i.e., bit positions that have value <𝜅 ) can be masked or need not be observed during this portion of thetest ﬂow. Circuits that pass all the malignant fault tests canthen be tested for all the benign faults. Now only the lowersigniﬁcant bits need to be observed. This is because benignfaults, by deﬁnition, have no input vector that results in anoutput whose value deviates from the fault free value by morethan tolerance threshold ( 𝜅).

Note that this procedure canbe extended to more binning levels by ﬁrst partitioning theentire fault set into desired number of benignity levels, then selectively propagating faults in each of these benignity levels to speciﬁc outputs and masking the rest. The test ﬂow alwaysbegins by testing malignant faults (by propagating them tothe MSB) and then proceeds towards benign faults (that arepropagated to LSB). V.

More- over, internal cell defects have become a major yield limiter because of aggressive scaling of design rules and lithography limitations in printing the features, giving rise to cell-aware test [19]. In addition to the regular stuck-at and timing faults at the cell I/O level, at advanced technologies, the transistor-level and other cell-internal faults need to be added to the fault list as yield has become more vulnerable to internal cell defects [ 20].

Using the reduced test pattern set for critical faults, only the critical faults of the AI accelerator can be tested as a quick method to assess the yield. Next, the chips that passed the ﬁrstyield-test can be tested for non-critical faults to grade those into different speed/throughput bins. The accelerators in the top bin (i.e., without any fault) can be sold at a premium price for safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars, whereas accelerators in the lower bins (with few faults, e.g., less than 5% fault rate) can be used in other AI/deep-learning tasks that can tolerate errors with minimal performance loss. \u000fA strategy of fault-aware trai"}

In [ 28][29], using benchmark-driven analysis each neuron was ranked according to its sensitivity and error contribution to the output, and neurons that contributed the least to the error were then approximated and the network was retrained to recover accuracy loss. In hardware, neurons that were approximated were assigned to approximate PEs, while others were assigned to exact PEs [ 28][29]. However, the challenges with these approximate approaches are, (i) sensitivity-based sorting, ap- proximation, and retraining of neurons are always dependent on the workload [ 29][31]. (ii) Assigning less sensitive neurons to approximate PEs will require runtime hardware reconﬁguration for different tasks.

Since this approach is expensive and not scalable, a functional test method was proposed [ 32], where real workloads - the test images from MNIST and CIFAR10 benchmarks - are applied as test input to the gate-level netlist of the implemented neural network. To ﬁnd if a fault was critical or ignorable, the fault was ﬁrst injected into a neuron module and the test image set was applied. If the prediction accuracy of the test image set was within a certain threshold, the fault was considered unim- portant, otherwise, it was a critical fault. However, the proposed simple approach of creating RTL of the full neural network, followed by gate-level synthesis and fault injection may not be scalable for mainstream CNNs [ 44] such as AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, etc. that are used for real-world computer vision tasks of image recognition with many classes [ 1][2][14]. In [33] the authors ﬁrst identiﬁed the location of faulty MACs (i.e., MAC i;j), in the TPU systolic array and then all weights that were mapped to those faulty MACs were pruned (i.e.,8wi;j=0,where i;j=location of "}

Extra bypass MUX was required for each MAC to bypass it in case it was faulty. However, the major challenges of this approach are, (i) the pruning with retraining technique can preserve the model accuracy when only the small magnitude weights are pruned [ 24]-[26]. If a large magnitude weight is mapped to a faulty MAC, this method will result in accuracy degradation. (ii) Moreover, in modern AI/deep learning the models are already pruned [ 24]-[26] to reduce energy consumption and storage requirements, as a result further pruning of weights - corresponding to the faulty MACs - of an already pruned model will signiﬁcantly reduce its accuracy. (iii) Another drawback of [ 33] is that weight pruning and retraining needs to be performed for each TPU chip based on its unique fault map and each individual workload.

As shown in Fig. 1 (a), a deep NN consists of an input layer, followed by several hidden layers and a ﬁnal output layer. Depending on the data size, the complexity of training, dropout, and pruning rate, some layers in the NN are fully connected and others sparsely connected [ 24]-[27].

Depending on if the accelerators are for training and inference or only for inference on edge devices, the MAC units can be of 32 bits supporting FP32 or 8 bits for int8 [39] quantized operations [ 1][38]. As shown in Fig. 2, the ac- celerator architectures can be categorized into two domains, (i) tightly-coupled 2D systolic-arrays (e.g., Google’s TPU) [ 4][9], and (ii) loosely coupled spatial arrays with independent PEs interconnected with NoC/mesh and using SIMD architecture [2][37]. While spatial SIMD designs offer higher ﬂexibility by allowing independent control and deactivation of PEs as needed, systolic arrays must work in lock-step and need more sophisticated techniques to deactivate individual PEs [ 33][36]. To optimize silicon utilization, the large number of PE/MACs are densely placed on the chip die [ 1]-[4].

Also, this will allow more chips to pass the functional test (within an accuracy bound of the AI task) resulting in improved yield (i.e., more accelerator passing the quality test at different specs or product bins).

YAOTA: Y IELD AND ACCURACY AWARE OPTIMUM TEST FOR AI A CCELERATORS The semiconductor manufacturing defects and corresponding circuit faults in the AI accelerator need a deeper investigation with regards to its impact on the accuracy of AI and deep learning workloads. The key modules of accelerators that are susceptible to defects are the weight storage SRAM/Register Files (RF) and the MACs. For SRAM/RF, the faults are generally repaired with ECC and spare cells.

The stuck-at faults in the MAC are permanent and severe, and thus in this work, we focus on stuck-at faults. Any stuck-at faults on the bﬂoat16/ﬂoat32 format [ 41] or 8-bit (for int8 quantization [39]) multipliers and adders will cause a certain precision loss and inaccuracy at the output of MAC. The important question is,“in an AI accelerator with thousands of PEs with MAC units, will the presence of a few faulty MACs cause the whole accelerator chip to be discarded, resulting in the loss of yield and revenue?” A scientiﬁcally pragmatic solution would be to assess the impact of MAC circuit faults on the training and inference accuracy of AI workloads executed on these accelerators. The key factors to consider in this assessment are, (i) location of the faults inside the PE and its impact on the precision of MAC output, (ii) the fraction of the total PEs that have faulty MACs, (iii) the type of AI workload, and (iv) if the accelerator is for both training and inference, or inference-only.

A. Fault location, MAC Precision and AI Accuracy Systematic defects and yield losses are caused by layout- sensitive lithographic hotspots and other process imperfections,variations, and are generally independent of the layout area [ 17]. On the other hand, random defect generated yield losses are caused by defect particles and are dependent on the standard- cell or the layout area as well as the defect particle size [ 16][18]. These defects (e.g., short/open defect, poor contact/via, etc.) and corresponding circuit faults can occur at different sites inside the MAC circuit block. The precision loss - due to the presence of circuit faults - at the output of multiply and accumulate operation will depend on the location of the fault inside MAC circuit and the logic cone impacted by the fault. For example, if a multiplier circuit that performs the multiplication of two 8-bit numbers, has faults impacting upto KLSB bits, then it will sustain worst-case error of \u0006åK+1 i=02i(the last 2K+1 term comes from worst-case carry-"}

As Kincreases, the faults impact the more signiﬁcant digits causing the worst-case error of the multiplier to increase. Similarly, errors will also occur in the adder circuit of the MAC if it is corrupted by faults. Since the multiplier is the more dominant block in a MAC, it will be more prone to faults and computation errors. As explained in Section II(B), the computations in NNs and CNNs for an AI workload execution are heavily dominated by the MAC operations. Any inaccuracy in MAC output will impact the accuracy and efﬁcacy of the AI task running on the accelerator. From the matrix multiplications in NN and convolution operations in CNN, it can be inferred that despite a certain amount of error in a few MAC modules, the AI tasks can be accomplished with minimum accuracy loss.

In this logic cone analysis, we assume ripple-carry adders are not used in the MAC module as the width of theadder/multiplier required for the AI tasks are at least 8 bits, and ripple-carry structures in these cases will cause long critical paths and hence slower speeds. Our analysis assumes the use of faster carry-lookahead or tree adders (the standard type used in 8 bit or wider cases) in the MAC. Note that, in the unusual event that a slower ripple-carry structure is used, the logic cone of LSB bits will completely overlap with the rest of the bits.

Bﬂoat16/ﬂoat32 can be used for both training and inference, but for inference-only devices (e.g., mobile and other edge devices) the training is generally done in Bﬂoat16/ﬂoat32 [ 40][41] and then the learned parameters are quantized to int8 and loaded in these devices [ 3][38]. The Baugh-Wooly multiplier [ 45] - widely used for multiplying two 8-bit signed numbers - is shown in Fig. 4 (a).

For AI accelerators using bﬂoat16/ﬂoat32 format multiplier and adder [ 40][41], as shown in Fig. 5, circuit faults in logic cones of some of the lower order (i.e., LSBs) bits of mantissa can be considered as non-critical, and the circuit faults present in the logic cones of the rest of the bits of mantissa, the exponent and sign bits are considered critical as they can introduce large errors in the result. The number of bits in mantissa that can be considered non-critical will depend on the amount of error introduced by stuck-at faults on those bits and the impact of this error in AI task’s accuracy loss.

Since mobile and other edge devices cannot sustain this computational overhead, the general trend for these devices is to use a pre-trained model during inference. In this mode, using many CPU/GPUs and dedicated accelerators the AI model is trained on the cloud, and after training the model parameters and weights are loaded in the edge device where a local AI accelerator is used to perform the MAC operations required for inference [ 1][38].

(ii) Although there will be additional time required for this training step, this extra cost will be amortized on the multiple inference runs. Because, the general trend in AI is to train the NN/CNN once accurately, and then this pre-trained model is used many times during inference.

On demand deactivation and bypass of these PEs require different strategies for SIMD and Systolic architectures. 1) SIMD Architectures: In SIMD architecture the loosely coupled independent PEs are connected with NoC or mesh and can be individually switched off and bypassed with wires [1][37]. Using the results from the FSR, all PEs with critical faults and few PEs with non-critical faults are deactivated. If after deactivation, ‘ Nremaining PE’ PEs remain out of ‘Ntotal PE’, then throughput of the accelerator will be scaled by the factor (Nremaining PE=Ntotal PE). 2) Systolic Architectures: The tightly-coupled 2D systolic- arrays in TPU introduce challenges in deactivating and bypassing individual PEs. A common technique is to use spare PE blocks to substitute for faulty PEs [ 36]. However, this approach requires complex wiring between spare and faulty PEs.

Unlike [ 33], as discussed in details in Section II(A), this approach does not require the NN/CNN weights that are mapped on the faulty PEs to be pruned (i.e., set to zero). The fault-free scenario is shown in Fig. 9(a), where the weights are pre-loaded in the PEs of the systolic array in regular manner. In Fig. 9(b), the PE in row 2, column 4 of the systolic array has a critical fault or non-critical fault exceeding acceptable fault-rate (marked with a red cross) and needs to be bypassed. In software, this is accomplished by shifting the column of the weight matrix to the right by inserting a dummy row of zeros. The activation matrix, X, is also shifted accordingly as shown in Fig. 9(b).

For the largest weight matrix in CNN/NN multiple iteration steps ( Nsteps ) are required in the accelerator array to complete the MAC operations. For example, in AlexNet largest weight matrix is of size 4096 by 9216, and this will require multiple iterations to complete in a systolic array with 256 by 256 PEs (e.g., Google TPU [ 4]). If the row/column size of systolic array is ‘ Ndim sysarr’ and the number of columns in accelerator PE array that has atleast one PE requiring fault-induced deactivation is ‘ Nsysarr f aulty cols’, then software-level deactivation will require extra (Ndim sysarr\u0003Nsysarr f aulty cols)\u0003Nsteps MAC operations.

The reason that the number of test patterns for the all-faults case is lower than the sum of critical- only and non-critical-only cases is due to the method of ATPG pattern generation, where a single pattern can sometimes detect faults from both critical and non-critical groups. However, the test pattern counts to test the critical-only faults is less than the all-faults case in Table I.

To analyze the impact of PE/MAC faults on the inference accuracy of NN, we implemented a 4-layer NN with two hidden layers, and varied the number of neurons in the hidden layers. Also, both un-pruned and 30% pruned (with-retraining) [24]-[26] versions were implemented. For NN experiments we used MATLAB deep learning toolbox [ 48]. All weights and activations were quantized in int8 format using MATLAB Fixed-Point tool [ 48].

With pruning (Fig. 12 (b)), the accuracy degrades slightly more with faults. This is because with pruning less number of neurons are present, and those that are present become more important. To assess the impact of MAC circuit faults on the accuracy of CNN, we used several key benchmark CNNs – AlexNet [11], VGG-16 [ 13], ResNet-50 [ 12] and LeNet-5 [ 44]. The number of convolution, linear layers and the total number of multiplication and additions required (without pruning) to classify each image in these networks are tabulated in Table III.

Next, we pruned 30% of the ﬁlter weights of the convolution layers and repeated our fault injection experiments.

Based on these ﬁndings [ 31], in our experiment as an approx. multiplier, we chose mul8134 from the open-source library of EvoApprox8b [ 42]. As discussed in [28][31], the accuracy of CNN/NN using approximate multipliers are very sensitive to proper training compared to regular multipliers, and the backpropagation training phase must be updated to account for approximate computing. In our experiment, the initial training phase was updated (using Pytorch’s hook functions [ 49]) to account for the use of 8-bit approx. multiplier, also int8 quantization was used. From Fig. 15, it can be observed that the presence of faults will degrade the performance of NNs with approx. multipliers signiﬁcantly.

Hence, if yield loss reduction is the primary goal, exact MAC units need to be used to account for possible circuit faults. From these detailed analyses of gate-level synthesis, fault isolation, ATPG pattern generation for the MAC circuit, and corresponding simulation of fault effects on standard NN/CNN benchmarks, it can be observed that certain circuit faults - based on their locations in the circuit - have minimal impact on the AI task’s accuracy when the fault rate is within an upper limit. For example, with 5% fault rate in non-critical gates, the normalized Top-5 accuracy loss in CNNs is less than 1% (Fig. 13(f)(h)). If this 1% accuracy loss is acceptable, and if there are more than 5% faulty PEs, then using the IDs of faulty PEs stored in the Fault Status Register, some faulty PEs can de deactivated on each column of the accelerator such that the fault rate is within 5% on each column of the PE array. For instance, in Fig. 13(h), at 10% fault-rate the normalized Top-5 accuracy degradation is 3.2% for AlexNet, but after deactivating few faulty PEs uniformly in each column of the accelerator the fault-rate per column can be reduced to 5% and this will r"}

As a result, an AI accelerator chip with few faulty PEs can be binned accordingly and shipped, improving valuable yield and revenue. The tradeoff in this yield saving would be the lower number of PE blocks in the accelerator due to the deactivation of few faulty PEs to keep the fault rate within an acceptable limit (i.e., 5%), however, this will not have any functional impact, and will only reduce the throughput marginally. Furthermore, the reduced throughput PEs can be binned and priced differently without totally discarding the chip, thus saving yield. For example, the accelerators with no fault at all can be placed in the top bin and sold at a premium price to be used in safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars, whereas accelerators in the lower bins (with few faults, e.g., less than 5% fault rate) can be used in other AI/deep-learningtasks that can tolerate errors with minimal performance loss.

In [33] when considering faults, authors assumed the complete MAC unit (i.e., all bits) was faulty, in contrast, our approach is more pragmatic and conservative. We analyzed our faults within groups of bits (i.e., logic cone of certain LSBs Vs. logic cone of the rest). If there are any errors beyond a certain LSB position we deactivate that PE to avoid a large extent of error in the accuracy. The complexity and cost of our approach are also minimal. For identifying the allowable non-critical fault rate and the number of LSBs, our search space is limited as we choose few LSB bits and fault rates (Fig. 10). Moreover, inference is not necessarily time-consuming and if such an analysis is performed once per hardware with an exhaustive benchmark like ImageNet [ 14], then it will sufﬁce for any other benchmark.

Hence, our fault-aware training does not add extra complexity compared to regular training. As we conﬁne our faults within a few LSBs, our approach does not require hardware fault location-aware AI workload mapping and retraining as in [ 33]. In our experiments we used the state-of-the-art CNNs that were pre-trained with 1 million images from ImageNet [ 14]. Be- cause of the large training set, these CNNs are very well-trained for any other type of pattern recognition/AI task (i.e., similar to the concept of “transfer learning” where ImageNet pre-trained networks can be used for any other pattern recognition problem by adjusting and training the ﬁnal layers). Also, for validation of our fault effects, we used the 50K sample validation images from ImageNet with PyTorch.

C ONCLUSION In this paper, we presented a yield loss reduction and test methodology for AI accelerator chips densely packed with PEs. Exploiting the error-healing properties of backpropagation during training and the inherent fault tolerance features of trained AI models during inference, we obtained an analytical relationship between fault location and fault rate of MAC, and the AI task’s accuracy to guide yield decisions. Simulation results on NN/CNN show that the proposed YAOTA approach will allow up to 5% faulty PEs in the accelerator at the expense of less than 1% loss in the AI task’s accuracy. Furthermore, the presented fault-aware binning strategy allows accelerators to be binned, with the goal of yield loss reduction, according to the fault-rate and target end-user applications.

These accelerators,designed with densely packed processing elements (PE), are espe-cially vulnerable to the manufacturing defects and functionalfaults common in the advanced semiconductor process nodesresulting in signiﬁcant yield loss. In this work, we demonstratean application-driven methodology of binning the AI acceler-ator chips, and yield loss reduction by correlating the circuitfaults in the PEs of the accelerator with the desired accuracyof the target AI workload. We exploit the inherent fault toler-ance features of trained deep learning models and a strategy ofselective deactivation of faulty PEs to develop the presented yieldloss reduction and test methodology.

In AI technology innovation and leadership, high-throughput AI accelerator hardware chips willserve as the differentiator [8], [10]. Millions of multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations are needed in modern AI tasks, for example, AlexNet [11] andResNET-50 [12] require 0.7 Billion and 3.7 Billion MACoperations, respectively, to classify a single image from theImageNet [14] dataset.

Although a relatively smaller size would minimize particle-induced random defects on upper metal layers in the chiplets and improve defect-induced yield loss, the individ-ual PEs—internal to the chiplet—will still be susceptible tosystematic defects [17] and lithography imperfections [15]that impact the transistor layers or the ultradense lower metallayers. As many PEs are densely placed in the AI accelerators, defects and circuit faults are likely to occur in some PEs. Fortunately, the stochasticity inherent in the backpropagation-based training of deep neural networks (NNs) and deepconvolutional NN (CNN)—the primary building blocks ofAI systems—offers a certain degree of resilience and errortolerance to deep learning tasks. Moreover, the intelligentapplication of techniques, such as dropout, pruning, and quan- tization during training can further increase the robustness of a trained NN/CNN against variations and noise during infer-ence [24]–[27].

The accelerators in the topbin (i.e., without any fault) can be sold at a premium price for safety-critical applications, such as self-driving cars, whereas accelerators in the lower bins (with fewfaults, e.g., less than 5% fault rate) can be used inother AI/deep-learning tasks that can tolerate errors withminimal performance loss. 3) A strategy of fault-aware training and selective deac- tivation of faulty PEs during inference is presented to minimize the accuracy loss due to faulty MACs. 4) Simulation results from 50 000 image samples on widely used CNN (AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG16, LeNet5) [44],and 10 000 data samples on different NN architecturesare presented to demonstrate the relationship betweenfault rate and accuracy.

In [28]and [29], using benchmark-driven analysis each neuron wasranked according to its sensitivity and error contribution to the output, and neurons that contributed the least to the error were then approximated and the network was retrained to recoveraccuracy loss.

In [32], a structural test ﬂow was proposedthat ﬁrst identiﬁed critical faults by comparing the accuraciesof the exact fault-free gate-level circuit of the neural network,and that of a faulty version. Next, the entire circuit was con- verted into an Boolean satisﬁability (SAT) instance and solved with SAT solver with test patterns for the critical faults only.Since this approach is expensive and not scalable, a functionaltest method was proposed [32], where real workloads—the testimages—are applied as test input to the gate-level netlist ofthe implemented neural network.

To ﬁnd if a fault was criticalor ignorable, the fault was ﬁrst injected into a neuron module and the test image set was applied. If the prediction accuracy of the test image set was within a certain threshold, the faultwas considered unimportant, otherwise, it was a critical fault.However, the proposed simple approach of creating RTL ofthe full neural network, followed by gate-level synthesis andfault injection is not scalable for mainstream CNNs [44], suchas AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, etc., that are used for real-world computer vision tasks of image recognition with many classes [1], [2], [14]. Zhang et al. [33] ﬁrst identiﬁed the location of faulty MACs (i.e., MAC i,j), in the TPU systolic array and then all weights that were mapped to those faulty MACs were pruned (i.e.,∀w i,j=0, where i,j= location of faulty MAC), followed by retraining. Extra bypass MUX was required for each MAC tobypass it in case it was faulty.

In contrast to permanent stuck-at faults, for low-energy operations where voltage is scaled down, possible timing [34]and memory errors [35] can also occur.

A. Fault Location, MAC Precision and AI Accuracy Systematic defects and yield losses are caused by layout- sensitive lithographic hotspots and other process imperfec- tions, variations, and are generally independent of the layoutarea [17]. On the other hand, random defect generated yieldlosses are caused by defect particles and are dependent on thestandard-cell or the layout area as well as the defect particlesize [16], [18]. These defects (e.g., short/open defect, poorcontact/via, etc.) and corresponding circuit faults can occur at different sites inside the MAC circuit block. The precision loss—due to the presence of circuit faults—at the output ofMAC operation will depend on the location of the fault insideMAC circuit and the logic cone impacted by the fault.

If this 1% accuracy loss is accept- able, and if there are more than 5% faulty PEs, then usingthe IDs of faulty PEs stored in the Fault Status Register, somefaulty PEs can de deactivated on each column of the acceler-ator such that the fault rate is within 5% on each column ofthe PE array. For instance, in Fig. 13(h), at 10% fault rate thenormalized Top-5 accuracy degradation is 3.2% for AlexNet, but after deactivating few faulty PEs uniformly in each column of the accelerator the fault-rate per column can be reduced to5% and this will result in improved Top-5 accuracy degra-dation to less than 1%. As a result, an AI accelerator chipwith few faulty PEs can be binned accordingly and shipped,improving valuable yield and revenue. The tradeoff in thisyield saving would be the lower number of PE blocks in theaccelerator due to the deactivation of few faulty PEs "}

The tradeoff in thisyield saving would be the lower number of PE blocks in theaccelerator due to the deactivation of few faulty PEs to keep the fault rate within an acceptable limit (i.e., 5%), however, this will not have any functional impact, and will only reducethe throughput marginally. Furthermore, the reduced through-put PEs can be binned and priced differently without totallydiscarding the chip, thus saving yield. For example, the accel-erators with no fault at all can be placed in the top bin andsold at a premium price to be used in safety-critical appli- cations, such as self-driving cars, whereas accelerators in the lower bins (with few faults, e.g., less than 5% fault rate) canbe used in other AI/deep-learning tasks that can tolerate errorswith minimal performance loss. In [33] when considering faults, authors assumed the com- plete MAC unit (i.e., all bits) was faulty, in contrast, ourapproach is more pragmatic and conservative. We analyzed our faults within groups of bits (i.e., logic cone of certain LSBs Vs. logic cone of the rest). If there are any errors beyond a certain LSB position we deactivate t"}

We analyzed our faults within groups of bits (i.e., logic cone of certain LSBs Vs. logic cone of the rest). If there are any errors beyond a certain LSB position we deactivate that PE to avoid a large extent of error in the accuracy. The complexity and cost of our approach are also minimal. For identifying the allowable noncritical fault rate and the number of LSBs, our search space is limited as we choose few LSB bits and fault rates (Fig. 10). Moreover, inference is not necessarily time-consuming and if such an analysis is performed once per hardware with an exhaustive benchmark like ImageNet [14], then it will sufﬁce for any other benchmark. For the fault-aware training part, only the forward pass function needs to be updated to reﬂect the MAC fault rate that would be present during inference, and thisis done for only one fault rate (e.g., 2.5% or 5% in Fig. 14). Hence, our fault-aware training does not add extra complexity compared to regular training. As we conﬁne our faults withina few LSBs, our approach does not require hardware fault location-aware AI workload mapping and retraining as in [33]. In our experiments we used the state-of-the-art CNNs that"}

Also, for validation of our fault effects, we used the 50K sample validation images from ImageNet with PyTorch.

We proposed two Mixup approaches to train Vision Transformer under only single defect WBM samples for mixed-type defects recognition. We use UnionMixup and Token level Max-Min-Saliency Mixup to generate mixed-type defect WBMs to feed Vision Transformers. In the recognition of two-mixed defect types WBMs, our method improves 17.1 % compared to baseline (none mixup) and we have 1.7% accuracy gain compared with state-of-the-art mixup approaches. In the recognition mixed defect samples containing more than two-mixed defects (three-mixed and four-mixed), we gain at least 24.7% (compared with baseline) and 11.1% (compared with single SOTA mixup) respectively.

Introduction The requirement and manufacture outputs of wafers have boosted in the latest decades which results in manual detec- tion inadequate. Each wafer has thousands of chips which should be analyzed by several detection devices at different phases of manufacturing procedure for defect detection. A wafer bin map (WBM) is a two dimensional binary map illustrates the electrical detection outcomes. Correct dies are specified a value of zero, while error dies are speci- fied a value of one. We classify these defect WBM patterns into 9 categories: Edge-Loc, Edge-Ring, Center, Scratch, Donut, Loc, Random, Near-Full, and Normal (with none defect) as shown in Fig.1. To achieve high outputs and high quality in wafer manufacture, we need better automatic ap- paratuses with high recognition accuracy of WBMs defect "}

To solve this issue, we propose an architecture that training vision transformers only by single-defect sam- ples and classify samples containing mixed-type defects. We use improved inputMixup [6] methods and Token-level mixup which makes significant improvements in recogniz- ing mixed-type defect WBMs that have not appeared in the single-type dataset. We propose Max-Min saliency Token Mixup(MMSTM for short) to improve the recognition ac- curacy of three or four mixed-types. MMSTM surpasses state-of-the-art mixup approaches on five different vision transformer models, and it demonstrates that our approach is not restricted to specific framework. After we have done UnionMixup of two type defect patterns, when the mixed WBMs are further mixed in MMSTM, three-mixed defect patterns or four-mixed patterns will be generated to feed the transformer.

Related work So far, most works focused on recognition of single-defect pattern WBMs, our target is the classification of mixed- type defect patterns in this paper. Seldom approaches have been suggested for the classification of mixed-type WBM defects. [7] trained individual CNN models for single defect and then combined the result of single-type CNNs for pre- dictions of the mixed-type defects classification.

Memory-augmented CNN model containing a triplet loss function had been mentioned in [9] to obtain effective low-dimensional embedding perform efficiently in imbal- anced WBM dataset. For the mixed-type WBM defects di- versify vastly in angles and positions, correct detection of defect patterns is challenging. Due to standard training in CNNs and transformers can only learn the common features while neglecting the rare features, as a result it brings bad generalization performance. [10] have shown that Mixup can successfully mix the common and rare features so that the gradients along these two features are correlated. Therefore, learning of rare feature can be boosted by the fast learning of common features, and eventually reaches a rather high level to outweigh the influences of noise on test samples. In order to detect mixed-type defect patterns, we propose a unique framework to incorporate UnionMixup and MMSTM into training Vision Transformers based on only single de- fect dataset.

Nonlinear mixup of two different random areas is one replacement of masking square areas [13] in cutMix method [14], while some variants considering arbitrary regions [15, 16, 17]. To avoid selecting localities randomly, saliency is applied to de- tect objects from different instances and combine them into one sample [18, 19, 20, 21]. And we do Token level Mixupbased on Max-Min saliency optimal assignment in trans- formers. We proposed a novel architecture to solve more challenging task like the detection of mixed-type patterns WBMs composed of four defects. The Transformer model will converges faster when the architecture has two phases of mixup algorithms: UnionMixup and MMSTM. 3. Methodology Here, we introduce UnionMixup and MMSTM. The goal of our method is to augment intermediate tokens while max- imizing the saliency level.

Based on the defect ratio defined in Equation (1), the defect complexity is determined. Considering the damage severity degree is rather high when defect ratio is larger than 0.5, so the high degree damaged wafers does not need to be mixed in the inputMixup process. However, all wafers will be trained in the transformer. 2 IEICE Electronics Express, Vol.VV, No.NN, 1–6 3.3 Union-Mixup for WBMs Let(x(𝑖),y(𝑖))be an WBM image x(𝑖)∈ D𝑙𝑜𝑤with its one-hot encoded class label y(𝑖)∈Y.

[22, 23, 24, 25] investigated the imbalanced information of tokens, and token level mixing randomly induces signifi- cant information loss and useless token exchanges. Rather than using gradient-based saliency detectors which requires substantial computation [18, 19], we exploit the benefit of self-attention map, an inherent saliency approximation in transformer modules. So we can deduce the saliency of the tokens from the attention imposed on the tokens as A=1 𝑁ℎÍ𝑁ℎ ℎ=1Aℎ,"}

Based on the estimated saliency of tokens, we aim at maximizing the overall saliency level by optimally assign- ing a different mixup target for each instance. Max-Min saliency optimal assignment is carried out between two in- stances: primary WBM and auxiliary WBM. It replaces a minimum-scored rectangle area of the primary image witha maximum-scored rectangle area of the auxiliary image, so as to maximize saliency of mixed WBMs. The visual- ization is in Fig.2, we partition the primary image x𝑝𝑟𝑖and the auxiliary image x𝑎𝑢𝑥into non-overlapping patches of size𝑃×𝑃.

Then, they are the input for a Vision Transformer to get the corresponding image saliency scores S𝑝𝑟𝑖∈R𝑛andS𝑎𝑢𝑥∈R𝑛. Simi- larly, we rearrange the shape of their image saliency score vectors, S𝑝𝑟𝑖andS𝑎𝑢𝑥, to matrices of 𝑛𝑟𝑜𝑤×𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑙. This method clips a rectangle area from the auxiliary WBM and pastes the rectangle area into the primary WBM to rebuild a mixed WBM.

Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed two mixup methods for training transformers based on single-defect pattern data to classify mixed-type defect WBMs. In the early stage, Union- Mixup can be used to do the mixup of WBMs with low de- fect ratio. Later, MMSTM is applied during the training of Vision Transformer. Our approaches solve the difficulty of obtaining mixed-type defect training dataset of WBMs in the recognition of WBM defect patterns.

Although several efﬁcient methods have been proposed, the site-to-site variation, which is often observed in multi-site testing for radio frequency circuits, has not yet been sufﬁciently addressed.

INTRODUCTION Large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs) are now embedded in every product to support the smooth functioning of our daily lives. In addition to automobiles, healthcare, and aerospace, which are directly related to human life, the LSIs are uti- lized in social infrastructure that supports our daily lives, such as computer networks, power transmission systems, and transportation control systems.

However, with the spread of the LSIs, their reliability has become a crucial issue, and faulty LSIs that do not operate properly not only interrupt the services of the systems that include them but also lead to a serious impact on our society. To guarantee the LSI reliability, multiple test items are tested and/or measured under various conditions during several stages of LSI manufacturing. With the increase in scale and multi-functionality of the LSIs, an increasing number of items need to be tested, leading to test cost inﬂation. Thus, it has become a serious problem because the test cost accounts for most of the LSI manufacturing cost. Various test cost reduction methods have been proposed that apply data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and statistical methods [1]–[3]. In particular, the wafer-level char- acteristic modeling method based on a statistical algorithm isthe most promising candidate that reduces the test cost, that is, measurement cost, without impairing the test quality [4]– [11].

In these studies, a statistical modeling technique was used to predict the entire measurement on a wafer from a small number of sample measurements. Because the estimation eliminates the need for measurement, it not only reduces the cost of measurement but also can be used to reduce the number of test items and/or change the test limits, which is expected to improve the efﬁciency of adaptive testing [12]–[15]. In [4], the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [16] was used to predict the measurement. In [5]–[8], a statistical prediction method, called a virtual prove , based on compressed sens- ing [17], [18] was proposed. The Gaussian process (GP)-based method [19] provides more accurate prediction results [9]– [11]. The use of GP modeling has another side beneﬁt. As it calculates the conﬁdence of a prediction, the user can conﬁrm whether the number and location of measurement samples are sufﬁcient, which is a signiﬁcant advantage from a practical viewpoint.

Most of these methods assume that the device character- istics on the wafer gradually change with wafer coordinates; however, this assumption does not hold for the measurement of radio frequency (RF) circuits under multi-site testing [20]– [22], in which a probe card is adapted to simultaneously probe multiple devices under test (DUTs). The contact of the probe card with the DUTs to be tested is called a touchdown . Moreover, the position of the needles in a touchdown is called asite. During the measurement of the RF circuit, a calibration circuit for impedance matching is added on the probe card, causing a much larger variation than the spatial variation due to its parasitic components, as shown in Fig. 1.

Furthermore, the locations of the black histograms are much different between the early and latest lots. The horizontal axis is expressed in arbitrary unit. Only the work in [11] attempted to solve this issue of the discontinuous change. In [11], a two-step modeling method using k-means clustering [23] and the GP was proposed. In the ﬁrst step, all dies on a wafer are explicitly measured, and then the k-means clustering algorithm is applied to divide the measurements into kmeasurement groups, and the wafer coordinates are also clustered according to the k measurement groups. In the second step, for the subsequently fabricated wafers, a GP is applied to each cluster individually. Because the spatial variation is modeled according to the par- titioned magnitude of the measured value, even discontinuous changes can be reproduced accurately.

In addition, there is a method [24] dealing with variations between the sites. In [24], in order to set outlier limits in a test, there is a method of eliminating the variation between sites by normalizing each site [24]. However, it is difﬁcult to set the normalization constant appropriately in small sampling, and thus it is difﬁcult to apply the site normalization to the wafer-level modeling. However, this method relies heavily on the assumption that the k-means clustering results obtained from the ﬁrst wafer are applicable to all subsequent lots. In fact, some site histograms drastically change in the latest fabrication lot, as shown in Fig. 1(b), which is the histograms in the sixth lot. For example, the highlighted black histogram should belong to a different cluster than that shown in Fig. 1(a) to achieve accurate prediction.

Therefore, the proposed method requires no clustering algorithm and no measurement corresponding to the ﬁrst step. The use of site information is straightforward, but it is efﬁcient under multi-site testing. Because the characteristics measured within one cluster have the same additional parasitic components of the calibration circuit, only spatial changes on the wafer are modeled; as a result, using the proposed method, accurate modeling can be achieved even across wafers.

Finally, we conclude the paper in Section V. II. P RELIMINARIES A. Gaussian process First, we quickly review a GP [19], which is an integral part of the conventional method [11] and our method. The GP model is used for estimating the function y=f(x) from the input variable xto the output variable y, which is often used for regression. In the GP model, the function fis assumed to follow a multidimensional normal distribution and is expressed as f\u0018 N(0;Z)using a kernel matrix Z. One of its advantages is its ability to deal with nonlinear estimation problems. Another important advantage is the use of Bayesian inference [26]. Because the estimated function is obtained as a distribution of functions, not as a single function, the uncertainty of the estimation can be expressed as a predictive variance. The outline of a GP-based multiple regression is summarized in Algorithm 1. We consider (Xtrain;ytrain) = f(x1; y1);(x2; y2);\u0001 \u0001 \u0001;(xN; yN)g andXtest= (x\u00031;x\u00032;\u0001 \u0001 \u0001;x\u0003M)as the training and test datasets, respectively, where M≫N.

The predictive mean \u0016is used in wafer-level characteristics modeling. It can be expected that GP regression can be incorporated into the wafer-level spatial variation modeling in IC characteristics with high afﬁnity, as the characteristics of adjacent dies on the wafer are similar because of the systematic components of process variation [29], [30].

The objective of the ﬁrst step is to partition the wafer into kgroups, which reﬂect the klevels of wafer measurement induced by discontinuous effects. For this purpose, the k- means algorithm is exploited as follows: y=fy(1);y(2);\u0001 \u0001 \u0001;y(k)g; (3) where yrepresents the vector of the measured characteristics of all the dies on the wafer.

It can be seen that the distributions within the site are comparatively maintained up to the ﬁrst two lots; however, they ﬂuctuate greatly from the third lot. This suggests that the two-step modeling may work well up to the ﬁrst two lots, whereas the clusters need to be recalibrated for the third and sixth lots, thus resulting in additional measurement costs.

In [10], an aggressive sampling method that preferentially measures the location with the largest predictive variance calculated by the GP regression is proposed. In addition, in [7], a Latin hypercube sampling approach [34] is employed to evenly choose random sample points over the entire wafer. However, these methods are straightforward, and most importantly, they do not consider multi-site testing environment.

Our dataset contains six lots. The ﬁrst wafer of each lot was used for the evaluation; thus, we used six wafers with different lots. A single wafer has approximately 6,000 DUTs. In this experiment, we used a measured character for an item of the dynamic current test, in which site-to-site variability due to the multi-site test is noticeably observed, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A heat map of the full measurement results for the ﬁrst wafer of the sixthlot is shown in Fig. 4. For the ease of experimentation, faulty dies were removed from the dataset.

As a result, a special pattern is observed during the multi-site test as shown in Fig. 4. To fully measure all DUTs on a single wafer, approximately 600 touchdowns are required. All experiments were implemented in the Python language. The RBF kernel was used as the kernel function fkernfor the GP-based regression. The experiments were conducted on a Linux PC with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8160 2.10 GHz central processing unit using a single thread. To quantitatively evaluate the modeling accuracy, we deﬁne the error \u000ebetween the correct ytrueand the predicted mean \u0016normalized by the maximum and minimum values of ytrue as follows: \u000e=\u0016\u0000ytrue dspec; (9) where dspecis the range between the minimum and maximum values of the fully measured characteristics in Fig. 4.

For comparison, naive GP regression-based approach (hereafter called naive GP ) [9] and the two-step approach (hereafter called 2-step GP ) [11] are also applied. Here, it should be noted that we do not consider the touchdown, that is, one-by-one measurement is conducted. The experimental result based on the touchdown is described later in Section IV-C. For the 2-step GP method, the ﬁrst wafer of the ﬁrst lot is used to obtain kclusters through k-means clustering. For the subsequent wafers, kclusters were used to predict the device characteristics. In the experiment, the optimal kwas determined using the silhouette value and elbow method [31], [32] instead of Eq. (5), resulting in seven clusters.

The prediction performance of the 2-step GP degrades as the production lot progresses, while the proposed method maintains a low prediction error below 2% regardless of the lot. This result implies that the k-means clustering result obtained in the ﬁrst lot is inappropriate for subsequent lots. We evaluated the calculation time of the prediction for each method. Figure 10 summarizes the calculation time of each method for the sixth lot at various sampling rates.

In general, the inference time of GP is O(N3) scaled because of the computation of the matrix inverse [35], [36].

C ONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a novel wafer-level spatial correlation modeling method for multi-site RF IC testing. The proposed method employs GP regression, which is an efﬁcient statistical modeling method used to predict the value for an unmeasured point from small sampling data. In the proposed method, GP is applied individually by partitioning the die location on a wafer according to the site information provided by the test engineers. In addition, we propose an active sampling method based on the predictive variance calculated by GP to achieve better prediction results while maintaining a small measurement cost. Experimental results using an industrial production test dataset demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a 19.46 times smaller prediction error than the conventional method. Moreover, we demon- strated that the proposed sampling method provides sufﬁcient prediction accuracy with 18 touchdown measurements, which corresp"}

Moreover, we demon- strated that the proposed sampling method provides sufﬁcient prediction accuracy with 18 touchdown measurements, which corresponds to 3% of the number of touchdowns for full measurement. In contrast, the prediction accuracy by random sampling required over 50 measurements. Although all the existing methods were evaluated with one DUT measurement, the proposed method achieved better prediction results by considering an actual touchdown under multi-site testing.
